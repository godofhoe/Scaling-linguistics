was now a-bout ni-ne o-clock and the room see-ming al-most su-per-na-tu-ral-ly qui-et af-ter the-se or-gies  be-gan to con-gra-tu-la-te my-self u-pon a lit-tle plan that had oc-cur-red to me just pre-vio-us to the en-tran-ce of the sea-men No man pre-fers to sleep two in a bed  fact yo-u would a good deal rat-her not sleep with yo-ur own brot-her  dont know how it is but peo-ple li-ke to be pri-va-te when they a-re slee-ping  when it co-mes to slee-ping with an un-known stran-ger in a stran-ge inn in a stran-ge town and that stran-ger a har-poo-neer then yo-ur ob-jec-tions in-de-fi-ni-te-ly mul-ti-ply Nor was the-re a-ny eart-hly rea-son why  as a sai-lor should sleep two in a bed mo-re than a-ny-bo-dy el-se for sai-lors no mo-re sleep two in a bed at sea than bac-he-lor Kings do as-ho-re To be su-re they all sleep to-get-her in o-ne a-par-tment but yo-u ha-ve yo-ur own ham-mock and co-ver yo-ur-self with yo-ur own blan-ket and sleep in yo-ur own skin The mo-re  pon-de-red o-ver this har-poo-neer the mo-re  a-bo-mi-na-ted the thought of slee-ping with him  was fair to pre-su-me that being a har-poo-neer his li-nen or wool-len as the ca-se might be would not be of the ti-diest cer-tain-ly no-ne of the fi-nest  be-gan to twitch all o-ver Be-si-des it was get-ting la-te and my de-cent har-poo-neer ought to be ho-me and going be-dwards Sup-po-se now he should tum-ble in u-pon me at mi-dnight-how could  tell from what vi-le ho-le he had been co-ming Lan-dlord Ive chan-ged my mind a-bout that har-poo-neerI shant sleep with him  try the bench he-re Just as yo-u plea-se  sor-ry  cant spa-re ye a ta-ble-cloth for a mat-tress and its a pla-guy rough board he-re-fee-ling of the knots and notc-hes But wait a bit Skrims-han-der Ive got a car-pen-ters pla-ne the-re in the bar-wait  say and  ma-ke ye snug e-nough So say-ing he pro-cu-red the pla-ne and with his old silk hand-kerc-hief first dus-ting the bench vi-go-rou-sly set to pla-ning a-way at my bed the whi-le grin-ning li-ke an a-pe The sha-vings flew right and left till at last the pla-nei-ron ca-me bump a-gainst an in-des-truc-ti-ble knot The lan-dlord was near sprai-ning his wrist and  told him for hea-vens sa-ke to quitt-he bed was soft e-nough to suit me and  did not know how all the pla-ning in the world could ma-ke ei-der down of a pi-ne plank So gat-he-ring up the sha-vings with a-not-her grin and thro-wing them in-to the great sto-ve in the mid-dle of the room he went a-bout his bu-si-ness and left me in a brown stu-dy  now took the mea-su-re of the bench and found that it was a foot too short but that could be men-ded with a chair But it was a foot too nar-row and the ot-her bench in the room was a-bout four inc-hes hig-her than the pla-ned o-ne-so the-re was no yo-king them  then pla-ced the first bench lengt-hwi-se a-long the on-ly clear spa-ce a-gainst the wall lea-ving a lit-tle in-ter-val be-tween for my back to set-tle down in But  soon found that the-re ca-me such a draught of cold air o-ver me from un-der the sill of the win-dow that this plan would ne-ver do at all es-pe-cial-ly as a-not-her cur-rent from the ric-ke-ty door met the o-ne from the win-dow and both to-get-her for-med a se-ries of small whirl-winds in the im-me-dia-te vi-ci-ni-ty of the spot whe-re  had thought to spend the night The de-vil fetch that har-poo-neer thought  but stop couldnt  steal a march on him-bolt his door in-si-de and jump in-to his bed not to be wa-ke-ned by the most vio-lent knoc-kings  see-med no bad i-dea but u-pon se-cond thoughts  di-smis-sed it For who could tell but what the next mor-ning so soon as  pop-ped out of the room the har-poo-neer might be stan-ding in the en-try all rea-dy to knock me down Still loo-king round me a-gain and see-ing no pos-si-ble chan-ce of spen-ding a suf-fe-ra-ble night un-less in so-me ot-her per-sons bed  be-gan to think that af-ter all  might be che-ris-hing un-war-ran-ta-ble pre-ju-di-ces a-gainst this un-known har-poo-neer Thinks   wait aw-hi-le he must be drop-ping in be-fo-re long  ha-ve a good look at him then and per-haps we may be-co-me jol-ly good be-dfel-lows af-ter allt-he-res no tel-ling But though the ot-her boar-ders kept co-ming in by o-nes twos and threes and going to bed yet no sign of my har-poo-neer Lan-dlord said  what sort of a chap is he-does he al-ways keep such la-te hours  was now hard u-pon twel-ve o-clock The lan-dlord chuc-kled a-gain with his lean chuc-kle and see-med to be migh-ti-ly tic-kled at so-met-hing bey-ond my com-pre-hen-sion No he an-swe-red ge-ne-ral-ly hes an ear-ly bir-dair-ley to bed and air-ley to ri-sey-es hes the bird what catc-hes the worm But to-night he went out a ped-dling yo-u see and  dont see what on airth keeps him so la-te un-less may be he cant sell his head Cant sell his headW-hat sort of a bam-boo-zin-gly sto-ry is this yo-u a-re tel-ling me get-ting in-to a to-we-ring ra-ge Do yo-u pre-tend to say lan-dlord that this har-poo-neer is ac-tual-ly en-ga-ged this bles-sed Sa-tur-day night or rat-her Sun-day mor-ning in ped-dling his head a-round this town Thats pre-ci-se-ly it said the lan-dlord and  told him he couldnt sell it he-re the mar-kets o-vers-toc-ked With what shou-ted  With heads to be su-re aint the-re too ma-ny heads in the world  tell yo-u what it is lan-dlord said  qui-te calm-ly yo-ud bet-ter stop spin-ning that yarn to meIm not green May be not ta-king out a stick and whit-tling a tooth-pick but  rayt-her guess yo-ull be do-ne brown if that e-re har-poo-neer hears yo-u a slan-de-rin his head  break it for him said  now flying in-to a pas-sion a-gain at this u-nac-coun-ta-ble far-ra-go of the lan-dlords  bro-ke a-rea-dy said he Bro-ke said Ibro-ke do yo-u mean Sar-tain and thats the ve-ry rea-son he cant sell it  guess Lan-dlord said  going up to him as cool as  He-cla in a snows-torm-lan-dlord stop whit-tling Yo-u and  must un-ders-tand o-ne a-not-her and that too wit-hout de-lay  co-me to yo-ur hou-se and want a bed yo-u tell me yo-u can on-ly gi-ve me half a o-ne that the ot-her half be-longs to a cer-tain har-poo-neer  a-bout this har-poo-neer whom  ha-ve not yet seen yo-u per-sist in tel-ling me the most mys-ti-fying and e-xas-pe-ra-ting sto-ries ten-ding to be-get in me an un-com-for-ta-ble fee-ling to-wards the man whom yo-u de-sign for my be-dfel-lo-wa sort of con-ne-xion lan-dlord which is an in-ti-ma-te and con-fi-den-tial o-ne in the hig-hest de-gree  now de-mand of yo-u to speak out and tell me who and what this har-poo-neer is and whet-her  shall be in all res-pects sa-fe to spend the night with him  in the first pla-ce yo-u will be so good as to un-say that sto-ry a-bout sel-ling his head which if true  ta-ke to be good e-vi-den-ce that this har-poo-neer is stark mad and Ive no i-dea of slee-ping with a ma-dman and yo-u sir yo-u  mean lan-dlord yo-u sir by trying to in-du-ce me to do so kno-win-gly would the-re-by ren-der yo-ur-self lia-ble to a cri-mi-nal pro-se-cu-tion Wall said the lan-dlord fetc-hing a long breath thats a pur-ty long sar-mon for a chap that rips a lit-tle now and then But be ea-sy be ea-sy this he-re har-poo-neer  ha-ve been tel-lin yo-u of has just ar-ri-ved from the south seas whe-re he bought up a lot of bal-med New Zea-land heads great cu-rios yo-u know and hes sold all on em but o-ne and that o-ne hes trying to sell to-night cau-se to-mor-rows Sun-day and it would not do to be sel-lin hu-man heads a-bout the streets when folks is goin to churc-hes He wan-ted to last Sun-day but  stop-ped him just as he was goin out of the door with four heads strung on a string for all the airth li-ke a string of i-nions This ac-count clea-red up the ot-her-wi-se u-nac-coun-ta-ble mys-te-ry and sho-wed that the lan-dlord af-ter all had had no i-dea of foo-ling me-but at the sa-me ti-me what could  think of a har-poo-neer who stay-ed out of a Sa-tur-day night clean in-to the ho-ly Sab-bath en-ga-ged in such a can-ni-bal bu-si-ness as sel-ling the heads of dead i-do-la-tors De-pend u-pon it lan-dlord that har-poo-neer is a dan-ge-rous man He pays re-glar was the re-join-der But co-me its get-ting drea-dful la-te yo-u had bet-ter be tur-ning flu-ke-sits a ni-ce bed Sal and me slept in that e-re bed the night we we-re spli-ced The-res plen-ty of room for two to kick a-bout in that bed its an al-migh-ty big bed that Why a-fo-re we gi-ve it up Sal u-sed to put our Sam and lit-tle Jo-hnny in the foot of it But  got a drea-ming and spraw-ling a-bout o-ne night and so-me-how Sam got pitc-hed on the floor and ca-me near brea-king his arm Arter that Sal said it wouldnt do Co-me a-long he-re  gi-ve ye a glim in a jif-fy and so say-ing he ligh-ted a can-dle and held it to-wards me of-fe-ring to lead the way But  stood ir-re-so-lu-te when loo-king at a clock in the cor-ner he ex-clai-med  vum its Sun-day-y-o-u wont see that har-poo-neer to-night hes co-me to anc-hor so-mew-he-re-co-me a-long then do co-me wont ye co-me  con-si-de-red the mat-ter a mo-ment and then up stairs we went and  was us-he-red in-to a small room cold as a clam and fur-nis-hed su-re e-nough with a pro-di-gio-us bed al-most big e-nough in-deed for a-ny four har-poo-neers to sleep a-breast The-re said the lan-dlord pla-cing the can-dle on a cra-zy old sea chest that did dou-ble du-ty as a washs-tand and cen-tre ta-ble the-re ma-ke yo-ur-self com-for-ta-ble now and good night to ye  tur-ned round from ey-e-ing the bed but he had di-sap-pea-red Fol-ding back the coun-ter-pa-ne  stoo-ped o-ver the bed Though no-ne of the most e-le-gant it yet stood the scru-ti-ny to-le-ra-bly well  then glan-ced round the room and be-si-des the beds-tead and cen-tre ta-ble could see no ot-her fur-ni-tu-re be-lon-ging to the pla-ce but a ru-de shelf the four walls and a pa-pe-red fi-re-board re-pre-sen-ting a man stri-king a wha-le  things not pro-per-ly be-lon-ging to the room the-re was a ham-mock las-hed up and thrown u-pon the floor in o-ne cor-ner al-so a lar-ge sea-mans bag con-tai-ning the har-poo-neers war-dro-be no doubt in lie-u of a land trunk Li-ke-wi-se the-re was a par-cel of ou-tlan-dish bo-ne fish hooks on the shelf o-ver the fi-re-pla-ce and a tall har-poon stan-ding at the head of the bed But what is this on the chest  took it up and held it clo-se to the light and felt it and smelt it and tried e-ve-ry way pos-si-ble to ar-ri-ve at so-me sa-tis-fac-to-ry con-clu-sion con-cer-ning it  can com-pa-re it to not-hing but a lar-ge door mat or-na-men-ted at the ed-ges with lit-tle tin-kling tags so-met-hing li-ke the stai-ned por-cu-pi-ne quills round an Indian moc-ca-sin The-re was a ho-le or slit in the

town in that sort of gui-se  put it on to try it and it weig-hed me down li-ke a ham-per being un-com-mon-ly shag-gy and thick and  thought a lit-tle damp as though this mys-te-rio-us har-poo-neer had been wea-ring it of a rai-ny day  went up in it to a bit of glass stuck a-gainst the wall and  ne-ver saw such a sight in my li-fe  to-re my-self out of it in such a hur-ry that  ga-ve my-self a kink in the neck  sat down on the si-de of the bed and com-men-ced thin-king a-bout this head-ped-dling har-poo-neer and his door mat After thin-king so-me ti-me on the be-dsi-de  got up and took off my mon-key jac-ket and then stood in the mid-dle of the room thin-king  then took off my coat and thought a lit-tle mo-re in my shirt slee-ves But be-gin-ning to feel ve-ry cold now half un-dres-sed as  was and re-mem-be-ring what the lan-dlord said a-bout the har-poo-neers not co-ming ho-me at all that night it being so ve-ry la-te  ma-de no mo-re a-do but jum-ped out of my pan-ta-loons and boots and then blo-wing out the light tum-bled in-to bed and com-men-ded my-self to the ca-re of hea-ven Whet-her that mat-tress was stuf-fed with corn-cobs or bro-ken croc-ke-ry the-re is no tel-ling but  rol-led a-bout a good deal and could not sleep for a long ti-me  last  slid off in-to a light do-ze and had pret-ty near-ly ma-de a good of-fing to-wards the land of Nod when  heard a hea-vy foo-tfall in the pas-sa-ge and saw a glim-mer of light co-me in-to the room from un-der the door Lord sa-ve me thinks  that must be the har-poo-neer the in-fer-nal head-ped-dler But  lay per-fec-tly still and re-sol-ved not to say a word till spo-ken to Hol-ding a light in o-ne hand and that i-den-ti-cal New Zea-land head in the ot-her the stran-ger en-te-red the room and wit-hout loo-king to-wards the bed pla-ced his can-dle a good way off from me on the floor in o-ne cor-ner and then be-gan wor-king a-way at the knot-ted cords of the lar-ge bag  be-fo-re spo-ke of as being in the room  was all ea-ger-ness to see his fa-ce but he kept it a-ver-ted for so-me ti-me whi-le em-ploy-ed in un-la-cing the bags mouth This ac-com-plis-hed ho-we-ver he tur-ned roundw-hen good hea-vens what a sight Such a fa-ce  was of a dark pur-plish yel-low co-lour he-re and the-re stuck o-ver with lar-ge blac-kish loo-king squa-res Yes its just as  thought hes a ter-ri-ble be-dfel-low hes been in a fight got drea-dful-ly cut and he-re he is just from the sur-geon But at that mo-ment he chan-ced to turn his fa-ce so to-wards the light that  plain-ly saw they could not be stic-king-plas-ters at all tho-se black squa-res on his cheeks They we-re stains of so-me sort or ot-her  first  knew not what to ma-ke of this but soon an in-kling of the truth oc-cur-red to me  re-mem-be-red a sto-ry of a whi-te ma-na wha-le-man toow-ho fal-ling a-mong the can-ni-bals had been tat-too-ed by them  con-clu-ded that this har-poo-neer in the cour-se of his dis-tant voy-a-ges must ha-ve met with a si-mi-lar a-dven-tu-re  what is it thought  af-ter all  on-ly his ou-tsi-de a man can be ho-nest in a-ny sort of skin But then what to ma-ke of his u-neart-hly com-ple-xion that part of it  mean lying round a-bout and com-ple-te-ly in-de-pen-dent of the squa-res of tat-too-ing To be su-re it might be not-hing but a good coat of tro-pi-cal tan-ning but  ne-ver heard of a hot suns tan-ning a whi-te man in-to a pur-plish yel-low o-ne Ho-we-ver  had ne-ver been in the South Seas and per-haps the sun the-re pro-du-ced the-se ex-traor-di-na-ry ef-fects u-pon the skin Now whi-le all the-se i-deas we-re pas-sing through me li-ke ligh-tning this har-poo-neer ne-ver no-ti-ced me at all But af-ter so-me dif-fi-cul-ty ha-ving o-pe-ned his bag he com-men-ced fum-bling in it and pre-sen-tly pul-led out a sort of to-ma-hawk and a seals-kin wal-let with the hair on Pla-cing the-se on the old chest in the mid-dle of the room he then took the New Zea-land hea-da ghas-tly thing e-noug-hand cram-med it down in-to the bag He now took off his ha-ta new bea-ver hatw-hen  ca-me nigh sin-ging out with fresh sur-pri-se The-re was no hair on his hea-dno-ne to speak of at leas-tnot-hing but a small scalp-knot twis-ted up on his fo-re-head His bald pur-plish head now loo-ked for all the world li-ke a mil-de-wed skull Had not the stran-ger stood be-tween me and the door  would ha-ve bol-ted out of it quic-ker than e-ver  bol-ted a din-ner Even as it was  thought so-met-hing of slip-ping out of the win-dow but it was the se-cond floor back  am no co-ward but what to ma-ke of this head-ped-dling pur-ple ras-cal al-to-get-her pas-sed my com-pre-hen-sion Igno-ran-ce is the pa-rent of fear and being com-ple-te-ly non-plus-sed and con-foun-ded a-bout the stran-ger  con-fess  was now as much a-fraid of him as if it was the de-vil him-self who had thus bro-ken in-to my room at the dead of night  fact  was so a-fraid of him that  was not ga-me e-nough just then to ad-dress him and de-mand a sa-tis-fac-to-ry an-swer con-cer-ning what see-med i-nex-pli-ca-ble in him Meanw-hi-le he con-ti-nued the bu-si-ness of un-dres-sing and at last sho-wed his chest and arms   li-ve the-se co-ve-red parts of him we-re chec-ke-red with the sa-me squa-res as his fa-ce his back too was all o-ver the sa-me dark squa-res he see-med to ha-ve been in a Thir-ty Ye-ars War and just es-ca-ped from it with a stic-king-plas-ter shirt Still mo-re his ve-ry legs we-re mar-ked as if a par-cel of dark green frogs we-re run-ning up the trunks of yo-ung palms  was now qui-te plain that he must be so-me a-bo-mi-na-ble sa-va-ge or ot-her ship-ped a-board of a wha-le-man in the South Seas and so lan-ded in this Chris-tian coun-try  qua-ked to think of it  ped-dler of heads too-per-haps the heads of his own brot-hers He might ta-ke a fan-cy to mi-ne-hea-vens look at that to-ma-hawk But the-re was no ti-me for shud-de-ring for now the sa-va-ge went a-bout so-met-hing that com-ple-te-ly fas-ci-na-ted my at-ten-tion and con-vin-ced me that he must in-deed be a heat-hen Going to his hea-vy gre-go or wra-pall or drea-dnaught which he had pre-vio-u-sly hung on a chair he fum-bled in the poc-kets and pro-du-ced at length a cu-rio-us lit-tle de-for-med i-ma-ge with a hunch on its back and e-xac-tly the co-lour of a three days old Con-go ba-by Re-mem-be-ring the em-bal-med head at first  al-most thought that this black ma-ni-kin was a real ba-by pre-ser-ved in so-me si-mi-lar man-ner But see-ing that it was not at all lim-ber and that it glis-te-ned a good deal li-ke po-lis-hed e-bo-ny  con-clu-ded that it must be not-hing but a woo-den i-dol which in-deed it pro-ved to be For now the sa-va-ge goes up to the emp-ty fi-re-pla-ce and re-mo-ving the pa-pe-red fi-re-board sets up this lit-tle hunch-bac-ked i-ma-ge li-ke a ten-pin be-tween the an-di-rons The chim-ney jambs and all the bricks in-si-de we-re ve-ry soo-ty so that  thought this fi-re-pla-ce ma-de a ve-ry ap-pro-pria-te lit-tle shri-ne or cha-pel for his Con-go i-dol  now scre-wed my ey-es hard to-wards the half hid-den i-ma-ge fee-ling but ill at ea-se mean-ti-me-to see what was next to fol-low First he ta-kes a-bout a dou-ble han-dful of sha-vings out of his gre-go poc-ket and pla-ces them ca-re-ful-ly be-fo-re the i-dol then lay-ing a bit of ship bis-cuit on top and ap-plying the fla-me from the lamp he kin-dled the sha-vings in-to a sa-cri-fi-cial bla-ze Pre-sen-tly af-ter ma-ny has-ty snatc-hes in-to the fi-re and still has-tier with-dra-wals of his fin-gers whe-re-by he see-med to be scorc-hing them ba-dly he at last suc-cee-ded in dra-wing out the bis-cuit then blo-wing off the heat and as-hes a lit-tle he ma-de a po-li-te of-fer of it to the lit-tle ne-gro But the lit-tle de-vil did not seem to fan-cy such dry sort of fa-re at all he ne-ver mo-ved his lips  the-se stran-ge an-tics we-re ac-com-pa-nied by still stran-ger gut-tu-ral noi-ses from the de-vo-tee who see-med to be pray-ing in a sin-gsong or el-se sin-ging so-me pa-gan psal-mo-dy or ot-her du-ring which his fa-ce twitc-hed a-bout in the most un-na-tu-ral man-ner  last ex-tin-guis-hing the fi-re he took the i-dol up ve-ry un-ce-re-mo-nio-u-sly and bag-ged it a-gain in his gre-go poc-ket as ca-re-les-sly as if he we-re a spor-tsman bag-ging a dead wood-cock  the-se que-er pro-cee-dings in-crea-sed my un-com-for-ta-ble-ness and see-ing him now ex-hi-bi-ting strong symp-toms of con-clu-ding his bu-si-ness o-pe-ra-tions and jum-ping in-to bed with me  thought it was high ti-me now or ne-ver be-fo-re the light was put out to break the spell in which  had so long been bound But the in-ter-val  spent in de-li-be-ra-ting what to say was a fa-tal o-ne Ta-king up his to-ma-hawk from the ta-ble he e-xa-mi-ned the head of it for an ins-tant and then hol-ding it to the light with his mouth at the han-dle he puf-fed out great clouds of to-bac-co smo-ke The next mo-ment the light was ex-tin-guis-hed and this wild can-ni-bal to-ma-hawk be-tween his teeth sprang in-to bed with me  sang out  could not help it now and gi-ving a sud-den grunt of as-to-nis-hment he be-gan fee-ling me Stam-me-ring out so-met-hing  knew not what  rol-led a-way from him a-gainst the wall and then con-ju-red him whoe-ver or wha-te-ver he might be to keep qui-et and let me get up and light the lamp a-gain But his gut-tu-ral res-pon-ses sa-tis-fied me at on-ce that he but ill com-pre-hen-ded my mea-ning Whoe de-bel yo-u-he at last sai-dyo-u no spea-ke dam-me  kil-le  so say-ing the ligh-ted to-ma-hawk be-gan flou-ris-hing a-bout me in the dark Lan-dlord for Gods sa-ke Pe-ter Cof-fin shou-ted  Lan-dlord Watch Cof-fin Angels sa-ve me Spea-ke tel-lee me whoe-e be or dam-me  kil-le a-gain grow-led the can-ni-bal whi-le his hor-rid flou-ris-hings of the to-ma-hawk scat-te-red the hot to-bac-co as-hes a-bout me till  thought my li-nen would get on fi-re But thank hea-ven at that mo-ment the lan-dlord ca-me in-to the room light in hand and lea-ping from the bed  ran up to him Dont be a-fraid now said he grin-ning a-gain Que-e-queg he-re wouldnt harm a hair of yo-ur head Stop yo-ur grin-ning shou-ted  and why didnt yo-u tell me that that in-fer-nal har-poo-neer was a can-ni-bal  thought ye knowd it-didnt  tell ye he was a ped-dlin heads a-round town-but turn flu-kes a-gain and go to sleep Que-e-queg look he-rey-o-u sab-bee me  sab-bee-y-o-u this man slee-pe yo-uy-o-u sab-bee Me sab-bee plen-ty-grun-ted Que-e-queg puf-fing a-way at his pi-pe and sit-ting up in bed Yo-u get-tee in he ad-ded mo-tio-ning to me with his to-ma-hawk and thro-wing the clot-hes to o-ne si-de He real-ly did this in not on-ly a ci-vil but a real-ly kind and cha-ri-ta-ble way  stood loo-king at him a mo-ment For all his tat-too-ings he was on the who-le a clean co-me-ly loo-king can-ni-bal Whats all this fuss  ha-ve been ma-king a-bout thought  to my-selft-he mans a hu-man being just as  am he has just as much rea-son to fear me as  ha-ve to be a-fraid of him Bet-ter sleep with a so-ber can-ni-bal than a drun-ken Chris-tian Lan-dlord said  tell him to stash his to-ma-hawk the-re or pi-pe or wha-te-ver yo-u call it tell him to stop smo-king in short and  will turn in with him But  dont fan-cy ha-ving a man smo-king in bed with me  dan-ge-rous Be-si-des  aint in-su-red This being told to Que-e-queg he at on-ce com-plied and a-gain po-li-te-ly mo-tio-ned me to get in-to be-drol-ling o-ver to o-ne si-de as much as to sayI wont touch a leg of ye Good night lan-dlord said  yo-u may go  tur-ned in and ne-ver slept bet-ter in my li-fe Upon wa-king next mor-ning a-bout day-light  found Que-e-quegs arm thrown o-ver me in the most lo-ving and af-fec-tio-na-te man-ner Yo-u had al-most thought  had been his wi-fe The coun-ter-pa-ne was of patc-hwork full of odd lit-tle par-ti-co-lou-red squa-res and trian-gles and this arm of his tat-too-ed all o-ver with an in-ter-mi-na-ble Cre-tan la-by-rinth of a fi-gu-re no two parts of which we-re of o-ne pre-ci-se sha-deo-wing  sup-po-se to his kee-ping his arm at sea un-met-ho-di-cal-ly in sun and sha-de his shirt slee-ves ir-re-gu-lar-ly rol-led up at va-rio-us ti-mest-his sa-me arm of his  say loo-ked for all the world li-ke a strip of that sa-me patc-hwork quilt Indeed par-tly lying on it as the arm did when  first a-wo-ke  could har-dly tell it from the quilt they so blen-ded their hues to-get-her and it was on-ly by the sen-se of weight and pres-su-re that  could tell that Que-e-queg was hug-ging me My sen-sa-tions we-re stran-ge Let me try to ex-plain them When  was a child  well re-mem-ber a so-mew-hat si-mi-lar cir-cums-tan-ce that be-fell me whet-her it was a rea-li-ty or a dream  ne-ver could en-ti-re-ly set-tle The cir-cums-tan-ce was this  had been cut-ting up so-me ca-per or ot-herI think it was trying to crawl up the chim-ney as  had seen a lit-tle sweep do a few days pre-vio-us and my ste-pmot-her who so-me-how or ot-her was all the ti-me whip-ping me or sen-ding me to bed sup-per-les-smy mot-her drag-ged me by the legs out of the chim-ney and pac-ked me off to bed though it was on-ly two o-clock in the af-ter-noon of the  Ju-ne the lon-gest day in the ye-ar in our he-misp-he-re  felt drea-dful-ly But the-re was no help for it so up stairs  went to my lit-tle room in the third floor un-dres-sed my-self as slow-ly as pos-si-ble so as to kill ti-me and with a bit-ter sigh got be-tween the sheets  lay the-re di-smal-ly cal-cu-la-ting that six-teen en-ti-re hours must e-la-pse be-fo-re  could ho-pe for a re-sur-rec-tion Six-teen hours in bed the small of my back ac-hed to think of it  it was so light too the sun shi-ning in at the win-dow and a great rat-tling of coac-hes in the streets and the sound of gay voi-ces all o-ver the hou-se  felt wor-se and wor-seat last  got up dres-sed and sof-tly going down in my stoc-kin-ged feet sought out my ste-pmot-her and sud-den-ly threw my-self at her feet be-seec-hing her as a par-ti-cu-lar fa-vour to gi-ve me a good slip-pe-ring for my mis-be-ha-vio-ur a-nyt-hing in-deed but con-dem-ning me to lie a-bed such an u-nen-du-ra-ble length of ti-me But she was the best and most cons-cien-tio-us of ste-pmot-hers and back  had to go to my room For se-ve-ral hours  lay the-re broad a-wa-ke fee-ling a great deal wor-se than  ha-ve e-ver do-ne sin-ce e-ven from the grea-test su-bse-quent mis-for-tu-nes  last  must ha-ve fal-len in-to a trou-bled nigh-tma-re of a do-ze and slow-ly wa-king from it-half stee-ped in dreamsI o-pe-ned my ey-es and the be-fo-re sun-lit room was now wrap-ped in ou-ter dar-kness Instan-tly  felt a shock run-ning through all my fra-me not-hing was to be seen and not-hing was to be heard but a su-per-na-tu-ral hand see-med pla-ced in mi-ne My arm hung o-ver the coun-ter-pa-ne and the na-me-less u-ni-ma-gi-na-ble si-lent form or phan-tom to which the hand be-lon-ged see-med clo-se-ly sea-ted by my be-dsi-de For what see-med a-ges pi-led on a-ges  lay the-re fro-zen with the most aw-ful fears not da-ring to drag a-way my hand yet e-ver thin-king that if  could but stir it o-ne sin-gle inch the hor-rid spell would be bro-ken  knew not how this cons-cio-u-sness at last gli-ded a-way from me but wa-king in the mor-ning  shud-de-rin-gly re-mem-be-red it all and for days and weeks and months af-ter-wards  lost my-self in con-foun-ding at-tempts to ex-plain the mys-te-ry Nay to this ve-ry hour  of-ten puz-zle my-self with it Now ta-ke a-way the aw-ful fear and my sen-sa-tions at fee-ling the su-per-na-tu-ral hand in mi-ne we-re ve-ry si-mi-lar in their stran-ge-ness to tho-se which  ex-pe-rien-ced on wa-king up and see-ing Que-e-quegs pa-gan arm thrown round me But at length all the past nights e-vents so-ber-ly re-cur-red o-ne by o-ne in fi-xed rea-li-ty and then  lay on-ly a-li-ve to the co-mi-cal pre-di-ca-ment For though  tried to mo-ve his ar-mun-lock his bri-de-groom clas-pyet slee-ping as he was he still hug-ged me tigh-tly as though naught but death should part us twain  now stro-ve to rou-se him-Que-e-queg-but his on-ly an-swer was a sno-re  then rol-led o-ver my neck fee-ling as if it we-re in a hor-se-col-lar and sud-den-ly felt a slight scratch Thro-wing a-si-de the coun-ter-pa-ne the-re lay the to-ma-hawk slee-ping by the sa-va-ges si-de as if it we-re a hatc-he-tfa-ced ba-by  pret-ty pic-kle tru-ly thought  a-bed he-re in a stran-ge hou-se in the broad day with a can-ni-bal and a to-ma-hawk Que-e-que-gin the na-me of goo-dness Que-e-queg wa-ke  length by dint of much wrig-gling and loud and in-ces-sant ex-pos-tu-la-tions u-pon the un-be-co-min-gness of his hug-ging a fel-low ma-le in that ma-tri-mo-nial sort of sty-le  suc-cee-ded in ex-trac-ting a grunt and pre-sen-tly he drew back his arm shook him-self all o-ver li-ke a New-foun-dland dog just from the wa-ter and sat up in bed stiff as a pi-kes-taff loo-king at me and rub-bing his ey-es as if he did not al-to-get-her re-mem-ber how  ca-me to be the-re though a dim cons-cio-u-sness of kno-wing so-met-hing a-bout me see-med slow-ly daw-ning o-ver him Meanw-hi-le  lay qui-e-tly ey-e-ing him ha-ving no se-rio-us mis-gi-vings now and bent u-pon nar-row-ly o-bser-ving so cu-rio-us a crea-tu-re When at last his mind see-med ma-de up touc-hing the cha-rac-ter of his be-dfel-low and he be-ca-me as it we-re re-con-ci-led to the fact he jum-ped out u-pon the floor and by cer-tain signs and sounds ga-ve me to un-ders-tand that if it plea-sed me he would dress first and then lea-ve me to dress af-ter-wards lea-ving the who-le a-par-tment to my-self Thinks  Que-e-queg un-der the cir-cums-tan-ces this is a ve-ry ci-vi-li-zed o-ver-tu-re but the truth is the-se sa-va-ges ha-ve an in-na-te sen-se of de-li-ca-cy say what yo-u will it is mar-vel-lous how es-sen-tial-ly po-li-te they a-re  pay this par-ti-cu-lar com-pli-ment to Que-e-queg be-cau-se he trea-ted me with so much ci-vi-li-ty and con-si-de-ra-tion whi-le  was guil-ty of great ru-de-ness sta-ring at him from the bed and watc-hing all his toi-let-te mo-tions for the ti-me my cu-rio-si-ty get-ting the bet-ter of my bree-ding Ne-vert-he-less a man li-ke Que-e-queg yo-u dont see e-ve-ry day he and his ways we-re well worth u-nu-sual re-gar-ding He com-men-ced dres-sing at top by don-ning his bea-ver hat a ve-ry tall o-ne by the by and thens-till mi-nus his trow-sers-he hun-ted up his boots What un-der the hea-vens he did it for  can-not tell but his next mo-ve-ment was to crush him-self-boots in hand and hat o-nun-der the bed when from sun-dry vio-lent gas-pings and strai-nings  in-fer-red he was hard at work boo-ting him-self though by no law of pro-prie-ty that  e-ver heard of is a-ny man re-qui-red to be pri-va-te when put-ting on his boots But Que-e-queg do yo-u see was a crea-tu-re in the tran-si-tion sta-ge-neit-her ca-ter-pil-lar nor but-ter-fly He was just e-nough ci-vi-li-zed to show off his ou-tlan-dis-hness in the stran-gest pos-si-ble man-ners His e-du-ca-tion was not yet com-ple-ted He was an un-der-gra-dua-te  he had not been a small de-gree ci-vi-li-zed he ve-ry pro-ba-bly would not ha-ve trou-bled him-self with boots at all but then if he had not been still a sa-va-ge he ne-ver would ha-ve dreamt of get-ting un-der the bed to put them on  last he e-mer-ged with his hat ve-ry much den-ted and crus-hed down o-ver his ey-es and be-gan crea-king and lim-ping a-bout the room as if not being much ac-cus-to-med to boots his pair of damp wrin-kled cow-hi-de o-nes-pro-ba-bly not ma-de to or-der eit-herrat-her pinc-hed and tor-men-ted him at the first go off of a bit-ter cold mor-ning See-ing now that the-re we-re no cur-tains to the

a-bout with lit-tle el-se but his hat and boots on  beg-ged him as well as  could to ac-ce-le-ra-te his toi-let so-mew-hat and par-ti-cu-lar-ly to get in-to his pan-ta-loons as soon as pos-si-ble He com-plied and then pro-cee-ded to wash him-self  that ti-me in the mor-ning a-ny Chris-tian would ha-ve was-hed his fa-ce but Que-e-queg to my a-ma-ze-ment con-ten-ted him-self with res-tric-ting his a-blu-tions to his chest arms and hands He then don-ned his waist-coat and ta-king up a pie-ce of hard soap on the washs-tand cen-tre ta-ble dip-ped it in-to wa-ter and com-men-ced lat-he-ring his fa-ce  was watc-hing to see whe-re he kept his ra-zor when lo and be-hold he ta-kes the har-poon from the bed cor-ner slips out the long woo-den stock uns-heat-hes the head whets it a lit-tle on his boot and stri-ding up to the bit of mir-ror a-gainst the wall be-gins a vi-go-rous scra-ping or rat-her har-poo-ning of his cheeks Thinks  Que-e-queg this is u-sing Ro-gerss best cu-tle-ry with a ven-gean-ce After-wards  won-de-red the less at this o-pe-ra-tion when  ca-me to know of what fi-ne steel the head of a har-poon is ma-de and how ex-cee-din-gly sharp the long straight ed-ges a-re al-ways kept The rest of his toi-let was soon ac-hie-ved and he prou-dly marc-hed out of the room wrap-ped up in his great pi-lot mon-key jac-ket and spor-ting his har-poon li-ke a mars-hals ba-ton  quic-kly fol-lo-wed suit and des-cen-ding in-to the bar-room ac-cos-ted the grin-ning lan-dlord ve-ry plea-san-tly  che-ris-hed no ma-li-ce to-wards him though he had been sky-lar-king with me not a

be-cau-se it is a sto-ry of the sin hard-hear-te-dness sud-den-ly a-wa-ke-ned fears the swift pu-nis-hment re-pen-tan-ce pray-ers and fi-nal-ly the de-li-ve-ran-ce and joy of Jo-nah  with all sin-ners a-mong men the sin of this son of Amit-tai was in his wil-ful di-so-be-dien-ce of the com-mand of Go-dne-ver mind now what that com-mand was or how con-vey-edw-hich he found a hard com-mand But all the things that God would ha-ve us do a-re hard for us to do-re-mem-ber tha-tand hen-ce he of-te-ner com-mands us than en-dea-vors to per-sua-de  if we o-bey God we must di-so-bey our-sel-ves and it is in this di-so-bey-ing our-sel-ves whe-rein the har-dness of o-bey-ing God con-sists With this sin of di-so-be-dien-ce in him Jo-nah still furt-her flouts at God by see-king to flee from Him He thinks that a ship ma-de by men will car-ry him in-to coun-tries whe-re God does not reign but on-ly the Cap-tains of this earth He skulks a-bout the whar-ves of Jop-pa and seeks a ship thats bound for Tars-hish The-re lurks per-haps a hit-her-to un-hee-ded mea-ning he-re By all ac-counts Tars-hish could ha-ve been no ot-her ci-ty than the mo-dern Ca-diz Thats the o-pi-nion of lear-ned men  whe-re is Ca-diz shi-pma-tes Ca-diz is in Spain as far by wa-ter from Jop-pa as Jo-nah could pos-si-bly ha-ve sai-led in tho-se an-cient days when the Atlan-tic was an al-most un-known sea Be-cau-se Jop-pa the mo-dern Jaf-fa shi-pma-tes is on the most eas-ter-ly coast of the Me-di-ter-ra-nean the Sy-rian and Tars-hish or Ca-diz mo-re than two thou-sand mi-les to the wes-tward from that just ou-tsi-de the Straits of Gi-bral-tar See ye not then shi-pma-tes that Jo-nah sought to flee worl-dwi-de from God Mi-se-ra-ble man  most con-temp-ti-ble and wort-hy of all scorn with slouc-hed hat and guil-ty ey-e skul-king from his God prow-ling a-mong the ship-ping li-ke a vi-le bur-glar has-te-ning to cross the seas So di-sor-de-red self-con-dem-ning is his look that had the-re been po-li-ce-men in tho-se days Jo-nah on the me-re sus-pi-cion of so-met-hing wrong had been ar-res-ted e-re he touc-hed a deck How plain-ly hes a fu-gi-ti-ve no bag-ga-ge not a hat-box va-li-se or car-pet-ba-gno friends ac-com-pa-ny him to the wharf with their a-die-ux  last af-ter much dod-ging search he finds the Tars-hish ship re-cei-ving the last i-tems of her car-go and as he steps on board to see its Cap-tain in the ca-bin all the sai-lors for the mo-ment de-sist from hois-ting in the goods to mark the stran-gers e-vil ey-e Jo-nah sees this but in vain he tries to look all ea-se and con-fi-den-ce in vain es-says his wretc-hed smi-le Strong in-tui-tions of the man as-su-re the ma-ri-ners he can be no in-no-cent  their ga-meso-me but still se-rio-us way o-ne whis-pers to the ot-her-Jack hes rob-bed a wi-dow or Joe do yo-u mark him hes a bi-ga-mist or Har-ry lad  guess hes the a-dul-te-rer that bro-ke jail in old Go-mor-rah or be-li-ke o-ne of the mis-sing mur-de-rers from So-dom Anot-her runs to read the bill thats stuck a-gainst the spi-le u-pon the wharf to which the ship is moo-red of-fe-ring fi-ve hun-dred gold coins for the ap-pre-hen-sion of a par-ri-ci-de and con-tai-ning a des-crip-tion of his per-son He reads and looks from Jo-nah to the bill whi-le all his sym-pat-he-tic shi-pma-tes now crowd round Jo-nah pre-pa-red to lay their hands u-pon him Frigh-ted Jo-nah trem-bles and sum-mo-ning all his bol-dness to his fa-ce on-ly looks so much the mo-re a co-ward He will not con-fess him-self sus-pec-ted but that i-tself is strong sus-pi-cion So he ma-kes the best of it and when the sai-lors find him not to be the man that is a-dver-ti-sed they let him pass and he des-cends in-to the ca-bin Whos the-re cries the Cap-tain at his bu-sy desk hur-rie-dly ma-king out his pa-pers for the Cus-tomsW-hos the-re  how that harm-less ques-tion man-gles Jo-nah For the ins-tant he al-most turns to flee a-gain But he ral-lies  seek a pas-sa-ge in this ship to Tars-hish how soon sail ye sir Thus far the bu-sy Cap-tain had not loo-ked up to Jo-nah though the man now stands be-fo-re him but no soo-ner does he hear that hol-low voi-ce than he darts a scru-ti-ni-zing glan-ce We sail with the next co-ming ti-de at last he slow-ly an-swe-red still in-ten-tly ey-e-ing him No soo-ner sir-Soon e-nough for a-ny ho-nest man that goes a pas-sen-ger Ha Jo-nah thats a-not-her stab But he swif-tly calls a-way the Cap-tain from that scent  sail with ye-he sayst-he pas-sa-ge mo-ney how much is thatIll pay now For it is par-ti-cu-lar-ly writ-ten shi-pma-tes as if it we-re a thing not to be o-ver-loo-ked in this his-to-ry that he paid the fa-re the-reof e-re the craft did sail  ta-ken with the con-text this is full of mea-ning Now Jo-nahs Cap-tain shi-pma-tes was o-ne who-se dis-cern-ment de-tects cri-me in a-ny but who-se cu-pi-di-ty ex-po-ses it on-ly in the pen-ni-less  this world shi-pma-tes sin that pays its way can tra-vel free-ly and wit-hout a pass-port whe-reas Vir-tue if a pau-per is stop-ped at all fron-tiers So Jo-nahs Cap-tain pre-pa-res to test the length of Jo-nahs pur-se e-re he jud-ge him o-pen-ly He char-ges him thri-ce the u-sual sum and its as-sen-ted to Then the Cap-tain knows that Jo-nah is a fu-gi-ti-ve but at the sa-me ti-me re-sol-ves to help a flight that pa-ves its rear with gold Yet when Jo-nah fair-ly ta-kes out his pur-se pru-dent sus-pi-cions still mo-lest the Cap-tain He rings e-ve-ry coin to find a coun-ter-feit Not a for-ger a-ny way he mut-ters and Jo-nah is put down for his pas-sa-ge Point out my sta-te-room Sir says Jo-nah now  tra-vel-wea-ry  need sleep Thou loo-kest li-ke it says the Cap-tain the-res thy room Jo-nah en-ters and would lock the door but the lock con-tains no key Hea-ring him foo-lis-hly fum-bling the-re the Cap-tain laughs low-ly to him-self and mut-ters so-met-hing a-bout the doors of con-victs cells being ne-ver al-lo-wed to be loc-ked wit-hin  dres-sed and dus-ty as he is Jo-nah throws him-self in-to his berth and finds the lit-tle sta-te-room cei-ling al-most res-ting on his fo-re-head The air is clo-se and Jo-nah gasps Then in that con-trac-ted ho-le sunk too be-neath the ships wa-ter-li-ne Jo-nah feels the he-ral-ding pre-sen-ti-ment of that sti-fling hour when the wha-le shall hold him in the smal-lest of his bo-wels wards Scre-wed at its a-xis a-gainst the si-de a swin-ging lamp sligh-tly os-cil-la-tes in Jo-nahs room and the ship hee-ling o-ver to-wards the wharf with the weight of the last ba-les re-cei-ved the lamp fla-me and all though in slight mo-tion still main-tains a per-ma-nent o-bli-qui-ty with re-fe-ren-ce to the room though in truth in-fal-li-bly straight i-tself it but ma-de o-bvio-us the fal-se lying le-vels a-mong which it hung The lamp a-larms and frigh-tens Jo-nah as lying in his berth his tor-men-ted ey-es roll round the pla-ce and this thus far suc-cess-ful fu-gi-ti-ve finds no re-fu-ge for his res-tless glan-ce But that con-tra-dic-tion in the lamp mo-re and mo-re ap-pals him The floor the cei-ling and the si-de a-re all aw-ry  so my cons-cien-ce hangs in me he groans straight u-pwards so it burns but the cham-bers of my soul a-re all in croo-ke-dness Li-ke o-ne who af-ter a night of drun-ken re-vel-ry hies to his bed still ree-ling but with cons-cien-ce yet pric-king him as the plun-gings of the Ro-man ra-ce-hor-se but so much the mo-re stri-ke his steel tags in-to him as o-ne who in that mi-se-ra-ble plight still turns and turns in gid-dy an-guish pray-ing God for an-ni-hi-la-tion un-til the fit be pas-sed and at last a-mid the whirl of woe he feels a deep stu-por steals o-ver him as o-ver the man who bleeds to death for cons-cien-ce is the wound and the-res naught to staunch it so af-ter so-re wres-tlings in his berth Jo-nahs pro-di-gy of pon-de-rous mi-se-ry drags him drow-ning down to sleep  now the ti-me of ti-de has co-me the ship casts off her ca-bles and from the de-ser-ted wharf the unc-hee-red ship for Tars-hish all ca-ree-ning gli-des to sea That ship my friends was the first of re-cor-ded smug-glers the con-tra-band was Jo-nah But the sea re-bels he will not bear the wic-ked bur-den  drea-dful storm co-mes on the ship is li-ke to break But now when the boa-tswain calls all hands to ligh-ten her when bo-xes ba-les and jars a-re clat-te-ring o-ver-board when the wind is shrie-king and the men a-re yel-ling and e-ve-ry plank thun-ders with tram-pling feet right o-ver Jo-nahs head in all this ra-ging tu-mult Jo-nah sleeps his hi-deo-us sleep He sees no black sky and ra-ging sea feels not the ree-ling tim-bers and lit-tle hears he or heeds he the far rush of the migh-ty wha-le which e-ven now with o-pen mouth is clea-ving the seas af-ter him Ay-e shi-pma-tes Jo-nah was go-ne down in-to the si-des of the shi-pa berth in the ca-bin as  ha-ve ta-ken it and was fast a-sleep But the frigh-te-ned mas-ter co-mes to him and shrieks in his dead ear What mea-nest thou  slee-per a-ri-se Star-tled from his let-har-gy by that di-re-ful cry Jo-nah stag-gers to his feet and stum-bling to the deck grasps a shroud to look out u-pon the sea But at that mo-ment he is sprung u-pon by a pant-her bil-low lea-ping o-ver the bul-warks Wa-ve af-ter wa-ve thus leaps in-to the ship and fin-ding no spee-dy vent runs roa-ring fo-re and aft till the ma-ri-ners co-me nigh to drow-ning whi-le yet a-float  e-ver as the whi-te moon shows her af-frigh-ted fa-ce from the steep gul-lies in the blac-kness o-ver-head ag-hast Jo-nah sees the rea-ring bows-prit poin-ting high u-pward but soon beat down-ward a-gain to-wards the tor-men-ted deep Ter-rors u-pon ter-rors run shou-ting through his soul  all his crin-ging at-ti-tu-des the Go-dfu-gi-ti-ve is now too plain-ly known The sai-lors mark him mo-re and mo-re cer-tain grow their sus-pi-cions of him and at last ful-ly to test the truth by re-fer-ring the who-le mat-ter to high Hea-ven they fall to cas-ting lots to see for who-se cau-se this great tem-pest was u-pon them The lot is Jo-nahs that dis-co-ve-red then how fu-rio-u-sly they mob him with their ques-tions What is thi-ne oc-cu-pa-tion When-ce co-mest thou Thy coun-try What peo-ple But mark now my shi-pma-tes the be-ha-vior of poor Jo-nah The ea-ger ma-ri-ners but ask him who he is and whe-re from whe-reas they not on-ly re-cei-ve an an-swer to tho-se ques-tions but li-ke-wi-se a-not-her an-swer to a ques-tion not put by them but the un-so-li-ci-ted an-swer is for-ced from Jo-nah by the hard hand of God that is u-pon him  am a He-brew he crie-sand thenI fear the Lord the God of Hea-ven who hath ma-de the sea and the dry land Fear him  Jo-nah Ay-e well migh-test thou fear the Lord God then Straigh-tway he now goes on to ma-ke a full con-fes-sion whe-reu-pon the ma-ri-ners be-ca-me mo-re and mo-re ap-pal-led but still a-re pi-ti-ful For when Jo-nah not yet sup-pli-ca-ting God for mer-cy sin-ce he but too well knew the dar-kness of his de-sertsw-hen wretc-hed Jo-nah cries out to them to ta-ke him and cast him forth in-to the sea for he knew that for his sa-ke this great tem-pest was u-pon them they mer-ci-ful-ly turn from him and seek by ot-her means to sa-ve the ship But all in vain the in-di-gnant ga-le howls lou-der then with o-ne hand rai-sed in-vo-kin-gly to God with the ot-her they not un-re-luc-tan-tly lay hold of Jo-nah  now be-hold Jo-nah ta-ken up as an anc-hor and drop-ped in-to the sea when ins-tan-tly an oi-ly calm-ness floats out from the east and the sea is still as Jo-nah car-ries down the ga-le with him lea-ving smooth wa-ter be-hind He goes down in the whir-ling heart of such a mas-ter-less com-mo-tion that he scar-ce heeds the mo-ment when he drops seet-hing in-to the yaw-ning jaws a-wai-ting him and the wha-le shoots-to all his i-vo-ry teeth li-ke so ma-ny whi-te bolts u-pon his pri-son Then Jo-nah pray-ed un-to the Lord out of the fishs bel-ly But o-bser-ve his pray-er and learn a weigh-ty les-son For sin-ful as he is Jo-nah does not weep and wail for di-rect de-li-ve-ran-ce He feels that his drea-dful pu-nis-hment is just He lea-ves all his de-li-ve-ran-ce to God con-ten-ting him-self with this that spi-te of all his pains and pangs he will still look to-wards His ho-ly tem-ple  he-re shi-pma-tes is true and fait-hful re-pen-tan-ce not cla-mo-rous for par-don but gra-te-ful for pu-nis-hment  how plea-sing to God was this con-duct in Jo-nah is shown in the e-ven-tual de-li-ve-ran-ce of him from the sea and the wha-le Shi-pma-tes  do not pla-ce Jo-nah be-fo-re yo-u to be co-pied for his sin but  do pla-ce him be-fo-re yo-u as a mo-del for re-pen-tan-ce Sin not but if yo-u do ta-ke heed to re-pent of it li-ke Jo-nah Whi-le he was spea-king the-se words the how-ling of the shrie-king slan-ting storm wit-hout see-med to add new po-wer to the preac-her who when des-cri-bing Jo-nahs seas-torm see-med tos-sed by a storm him-self His deep chest hea-ved as with a groun-dswell his tos-sed arms see-med the war-ring e-le-ments at work and the thun-ders that rol-led a-way from off his swart-hy brow and the light lea-ping from his ey-e ma-de all his sim-ple hea-rers look on him with a quick fear that was stran-ge to them The-re now ca-me a lull in his look as he si-len-tly tur-ned o-ver the lea-ves of the Book on-ce mo-re and at last stan-ding mo-tion-less with clo-sed ey-es for the mo-ment see-med com-mu-ning with God and him-self But a-gain he lea-ned o-ver to-wards the peo-ple and bo-wing his head low-ly with an as-pect of the dee-pest

Ishmael that the ma-gna-ni-mous God of hea-ven and earth-pa-gans and all in-clu-ded-can pos-si-bly be jea-lous of an in-si-gni-fi-cant bit of black wood Impos-si-ble But what is wors-hip-to do the

Thus then in our hearts ho-ney-moon lay  and Que-e-que-ga co-sy lo-ving pair We had lain thus in bed chat-ting and nap-ping at short in-ter-vals and Que-e-queg now and then af-fec-tio-na-te-ly thro-wing his brown tat-too-ed legs o-ver mi-ne and then dra-wing them back so en-ti-re-ly so-cia-ble and free and ea-sy we-re we when at last by rea-son of our con-fa-bu-la-tions what lit-tle

drawn up clo-se to-get-her and our two no-ses ben-ding o-ver them as if our knee-pans we-re war-ming-pans We felt ve-ry ni-ce and snug the mo-re so sin-ce it was so chil-ly out of doors in-deed out of bed-clot-hes too see-ing that the-re was no fi-re in the room The mo-re so  say be-cau-se tru-ly to en-joy bo-di-ly warmth so-me small part of yo-u must be cold for the-re is no qua-li-ty in this

fol-lo-wed by the nib-bling goats as if he we-re a green sa-pling e-ven then in Que-e-quegs am-bi-tio-us soul lur-ked a strong de-si-re to see so-met-hing mo-re of Chris-ten-dom than a spe-ci-men wha-ler or two His fat-her was a High Chief a King his un-cle a High Priest and on the ma-ter-nal si-de he boas-ted aunts who we-re the wi-ves of un-con-que-ra-ble war-riors The-re was ex-cel-lent

Alo-ne in his ca-noe he pad-dled off to a dis-tant strait which he knew the ship must pass through when she quit-ted the i-sland  o-ne si-de was a co-ral reef on the ot-her a low ton-gue of land co-ve-red with man-gro-ve thic-kets that grew out in-to the wa-ter Hi-ding his ca-noe still a-float a-mong the-se thic-kets with its prow sea-ward he sat down in the stern pad-dle low in hand and when the ship was gli-ding by li-ke a flash he dar-ted out gai-ned her si-de with o-ne bac-kward dash of his foot ca-psi-zed and sank his ca-noe clim-bed up the chains and thro-wing him-self at full length u-pon the deck grap-pled a ring-bolt the-re and swo-re not to let it go though hac-ked in pie-ces  vain the cap-tain threa-te-ned to throw him o-ver-board sus-pen-ded a cu-tlass o-ver his na-ked

he might ma-ke him-self at ho-me But this fi-ne yo-ung sa-va-get-his sea Prin-ce of Wa-les ne-ver saw the Cap-tains ca-bin They put him down a-mong the sai-lors and ma-de a wha-le-man of him But li-ke Czar Pe-ter con-tent to toil in the shi-pyards of fo-reign ci-ties Que-e-queg dis-dai-ned no see-ming i-gno-mi-ny if the-re-by he might hap-pi-ly gain the po-wer of en-ligh-te-ning his un-tu-to-red

im-mu-ta-ble-ness was the-re so-me lack of com-mon con-sis-ten-cy a-bout wort-hy Cap-tain Pe-leg Though re-fu-sing from cons-cien-tio-us scru-ples to bear arms a-gainst land in-va-ders yet him-self had il-li-mi-ta-bly in-va-ded the Atlan-tic and Pa-ci-fic and though a sworn foe to hu-man bloods-hed yet had he in his straight-bo-died coat spil-led tuns u-pon tuns of le-viat-han go-re How now in the con-tem-pla-ti-ve e-ve-ning of his days the pio-us Bil-dad re-con-ci-led the-se things in the re-mi-nis-cen-ce  do not know but it did not seem to con-cern him much and ve-ry pro-ba-bly he had long sin-ce co-me to the sa-ge and sen-si-ble con-clu-sion that a mans re-li-gion is o-ne thing and this prac-ti-cal world qui-te a-not-her This world pays di-vi-dends Ri-sing from a lit-tle

as  hin-ted be-fo-re had con-clu-ded his a-dven-tu-rous ca-reer by whol-ly re-ti-ring from ac-ti-ve li-fe at the goo-dly a-ge of six-ty and de-di-ca-ting his re-mai-ning days to the qui-et re-cei-ving of his wel-lear-ned in-co-me Now Bil-dad  am sor-ry to say had the re-pu-ta-tion of being an in-cor-ri-gi-ble old hunks and in his sea-going days a bit-ter hard tas-kmas-ter They told me in Nan-tuc-ket though it cer-tain-ly seems a cu-rio-us sto-ry that when he sai-led the old Ca-te-gut wha-le-man his crew u-pon ar-ri-ving ho-me we-re mos-tly all car-ried as-ho-re to the hos-pi-tal so-re ex-haus-ted and worn out For a pio-us man es-pe-cial-ly for a Qua-ker he was cer-tain-ly rat-her hard-hear-ted to say the least He ne-ver u-sed to swear though at his men they said but so-me-how he got an i-nor-di-na-te quan-ti-ty of cruel un-mi-ti-ga-ted hard work out of them When Bil-dad was a chie-fma-te to ha-ve his drab-co-lou-red ey-e in-ten-tly loo-king at yo-u ma-de yo-u feel com-ple-te-ly ner-vous till yo-u could clutch so-met-hin-ga ham-mer or a mar-lings-pi-ke and go to work li-ke mad at so-met-hing or ot-her ne-ver mind what Indo-len-ce and i-dle-ness pe-ris-hed be-fo-re him His own per-son was the e-xact em-bo-di-ment of his u-ti-li-ta-rian cha-rac-ter  his long gaunt bo-dy he car-ried no spa-re flesh no su-per-fluo-us beard his chin ha-ving a soft

be-tween the decks was small and the-re bol-tu-pright sat old Bil-dad who al-ways sat so and ne-ver lea-ned and this to sa-ve his coat tails His broad-brim was pla-ced be-si-de him his legs we-re stif-fly cros-sed his drab ves-tu-re was but-to-ned up to his chin and spec-ta-cles on no-se he see-med a-bsor-bed in rea-ding from a pon-de-rous vo-lu-me Bil-dad cried Cap-tain Pe-leg at it a-gain Bil-dad eh Ye ha-ve been stu-dying tho-se Scrip-tu-res now for the last thir-ty ye-ars to my cer-tain know-led-ge How far ye got Bil-dad  if long ha-bi-tua-ted to such pro-fa-ne talk from his old shi-pma-te Bil-dad wit-hout no-ti-cing his pre-sent ir-re-ve-ren-ce qui-e-tly loo-ked up and see-ing me glan-ced a-gain in-qui-rin-gly to-wards Pe-leg He says hes our man Bil-dad said Pe-leg he wants to ship Dost thee said Bil-dad in a hol-low to-ne and tur-ning round to me  dost said  un-cons-cio-u-sly he was so in-ten-se a Qua-ker What do ye think of him Bil-dad said Pe-leg Hell do said Bil-dad ey-e-ing me and then went on spel-ling a-way at his book in a mum-bling to-ne qui-te au-di-ble  thought him the que-e-rest old Qua-ker  e-ver saw es-pe-cial-ly as Pe-leg his friend and old shi-pma-te see-med such a blus-te-rer But  said not-hing on-ly loo-king round me shar-ply Pe-leg now threw o-pen a chest and dra-wing forth the ships ar-ti-cles pla-ced pen and ink be-fo-re him and sea-ted him-self at a lit-tle ta-ble  be-gan to think it was high ti-me to set-tle with my-self at what terms  would be wil-ling to en-ga-ge for the voy-a-ge  was al-rea-dy a-wa-re that in the wha-ling bu-si-ness they paid no wa-ges but all hands in-clu-ding the cap-tain re-cei-ved cer-tain sha-res of the pro-fits cal-led lays and that the-se lays we-re pro-por-tio-ned to the de-gree of im-por-tan-ce per-tai-ning to the res-pec-ti-ve du-ties of the ships com-pa-ny  was al-so a-wa-re that being a green hand at wha-ling my own lay would not be ve-ry lar-ge but con-si-de-ring that  was u-sed to the sea could steer a ship spli-ce a ro-pe and all that  ma-de no doubt that from all  had heard  should be of-fe-red at least the  layt-hat is the  part of the clear net pro-ceeds of the voy-a-ge wha-te-ver that might e-ven-tual-ly a-mount to  though the  lay was what they call a rat-her long lay yet it was bet-ter than not-hing and if we had a luc-ky voy-a-ge might pret-ty near-ly pay for the clot-hing  would wear out on it not to speak of my three ye-ars beef and board for which  would not ha-ve to pay o-ne sti-ver  might be thought that this was a poor way to ac-cu-mu-la-te a prin-ce-ly for-tu-neand so it was a ve-ry poor way in-deed But  am o-ne of tho-se that ne-ver ta-ke on a-bout prin-ce-ly for-tu-nes and am qui-te con-tent if the world is rea-dy to board and lod-ge me whi-le  am put-ting up at this grim sign of the Thun-der Cloud Upon the who-le  thought that the  lay would be a-bout the fair thing but would not ha-ve been sur-pri-sed had  been of-fe-red the  con-si-de-ring  was of a broads-houl-de-red ma-ke But o-ne thing ne-vert-he-less that ma-de me a lit-tle dis-trus-tful a-bout re-cei-ving a ge-ne-rous sha-re of the pro-fits was this Asho-re  had heard so-met-hing of both Cap-tain Pe-leg and his u-nac-coun-ta-ble old cro-ny Bil-dad how that they being the prin-ci-pal pro-prie-tors of the Pe-quod the-refo-re the ot-her and mo-re in-con-si-de-ra-ble and scat-te-red ow-ners left near-ly the who-le ma-na-ge-ment of the ships af-fairs to the-se two   did not know but what the stin-gy old Bil-dad might ha-ve a migh-ty deal to say a-bout ship-ping hands es-pe-cial-ly as  now found him on board the Pe-quod qui-te at ho-me the-re in the ca-bin and rea-ding his Bi-ble as if at his own fi-re-si-de Now whi-le Pe-leg was vain-ly trying to mend a pen with his jack-kni-fe old Bil-dad to my no small sur-pri-se con-si-de-ring that he was such an in-te-res-ted par-ty in the-se pro-cee-dings Bil-dad ne-ver hee-ded us but went on mum-bling to him-self out of his book Lay not up for yo-ur-sel-ves trea-su-res u-pon earth whe-re moth Well Cap-tain Bil-dad in-ter-rup-ted Pe-leg what dye say what lay shall we gi-ve this yo-ung man Thou kno-west best was the se-pulc-hral re-ply the se-ven hun-dred and se-ven-ty-se-venth wouldnt be too much would itw-he-re moth and rust do cor-rupt but lay Lay in-deed thought  and such a lay the se-ven hun-dred and se-ven-ty-se-venth Well old Bil-dad yo-u a-re de-ter-mi-ned that  for o-ne shall not lay up ma-ny lays he-re be-low whe-re moth and rust do cor-rupt  was an ex-cee-din-gly long lay that in-deed and though from the ma-gni-tu-de of the fi-gu-re it might at first de-cei-ve a lan-dsman yet the sligh-test con-si-de-ra-tion will show that though se-ven hun-dred and se-venty-se-ven is a pret-ty lar-ge num-ber yet when yo-u co-me to ma-ke a teenth of it yo-u will then see  say that the se-ven hun-dred and se-ven-ty-se-venth part of a fart-hing is a good deal less than se-ven hun-dred and se-venty-se-ven gold dou-bloons and so  thought at the ti-me Why blast yo-ur ey-es Bil-dad cried Pe-leg thou dost not want to swin-dle this yo-ung man he must ha-ve mo-re than that Se-ven hun-dred and se-ven-ty-se-venth a-gain said Bil-dad wit-hout lif-ting his ey-es and then went on mum-blin-gfor whe-re yo-ur trea-su-re is the-re will yo-ur heart be al-so  am going to put him down for the three hun-dredth said Pe-leg do ye hear that Bil-dad The three hun-dredth lay  say Bil-dad laid down his book and tur-ning so-lemn-ly to-wards him said Cap-tain Pe-leg thou hast a ge-ne-rous heart but thou must con-si-der the du-ty thou o-west to the ot-her ow-ners of this shi-pwi-dows and orp-hans ma-ny of the-mand that if we too a-bun-dan-tly re-ward the la-bors of this yo-ung man we may be ta-king the bread from tho-se wi-dows and tho-se orp-hans The se-ven hun-dred and se-ven-ty-se-venth lay Cap-tain Pe-leg Thou Bil-dad roa-red Pe-leg star-ting up and clat-te-ring a-bout the ca-bin Blast ye Cap-tain Bil-dad if  had fol-lo-wed thy a-dvi-ce in the-se mat-ters  would a-fo-re now had a cons-cien-ce to lug a-bout that would be hea-vy e-nough to foun-der the lar-gest ship that e-ver sai-led round Ca-pe Horn Cap-tain Pe-leg said Bil-dad stea-di-ly thy cons-cien-ce may be dra-wing ten inc-hes of wa-ter or ten fat-homs  cant tell but as thou art still an im-pe-ni-tent man Cap-tain Pe-leg  grea-tly fear lest thy cons-cien-ce be but a lea-ky o-ne and will in the end sink thee foun-de-ring down to the fie-ry pit Cap-tain Pe-leg Fie-ry pit fie-ry pit ye in-sult me man past all na-tu-ral bea-ring ye in-sult me  an all-fi-red ou-tra-ge to tell a-ny hu-man crea-tu-re that hes bound to hell Flu-kes and fla-mes Bil-dad say that a-gain to me and start my soul-bolts but IllIllyes  swal-low a li-ve goat with all his hair and horns on Out of the ca-bin ye can-ting drab-co-lou-red son of a woo-den gu-na straight wa-ke with ye  he thun-de-red out this he ma-de a rush at Bil-dad but with a mar-vel-lous o-bli-que sli-ding ce-le-ri-ty Bil-dad for that ti-me e-lu-ded him Alar-med at this ter-ri-ble out-burst be-tween the two prin-ci-pal and res-pon-si-ble ow-ners of the ship and fee-ling half a mind to gi-ve up all i-dea of sai-ling in a ves-sel so ques-tio-na-bly ow-ned and tem-po-ra-ri-ly com-man-ded  step-ped a-si-de from the door to gi-ve e-gress to Bil-dad who  ma-de no doubt was all ea-ger-ness to va-nish from be-fo-re the a-wa-ke-ned wrath of Pe-leg But to my as-to-nis-hment he sat down a-gain on the tran-som ve-ry qui-e-tly and see-med to ha-ve not the sligh-test in-ten-tion of with-dra-wing He see-med qui-te u-sed to im-pe-ni-tent Pe-leg and his ways  for Pe-leg af-ter let-ting off his ra-ge as he had the-re see-med no mo-re left in him and he too sat down li-ke a lamb though he twitc-hed a lit-tle as if still ner-vou-sly a-gi-ta-ted Whew he whis-tled at lastt-he squalls go-ne off to lee-ward  think Bil-dad thou u-sed to be good at shar-pe-ning a lan-ce

hun-dredth lay Cap-tain Pe-leg said   ha-ve a friend with me who wants to ship toos-hall  bring him down to-mor-row To be su-re said Pe-leg Fetch him a-long and well look at him What lay does he want groa-ned Bil-dad glan-cing up from the book in which he had a-gain been bu-rying him-self  ne-ver thee mind a-bout that Bil-dad said Pe-leg Has he e-ver wha-led it a-ny tur-ning to me Kil-led mo-re

part of his Ra-ma-dan do they fast on their hams that way in his na-ti-ve i-sland  must be so yes its part of his creed  sup-po-se well then let him rest hell get up soo-ner or la-ter no doubt  cant last for e-ver thank God and his Ra-ma-dan on-ly co-mes on-ce a ye-ar and  dont be-lie-ve its ve-ry punc-tual then  went down to sup-per After sit-ting a long ti-me lis-te-ning to the long sto-ries of so-me sai-lors who had just co-me from a plum-pud-ding voy-a-ge as they cal-led it that is a short wha-lin-gvoy-a-ge in a schoo-ner or brig con-fi-ned to the north of the li-ne in the Atlan-tic Ocean on-ly af-ter lis-te-ning to the-se plum-pud-din-gers till near-ly e-le-ven o-clock  went up stairs to go to bed fee-ling qui-te su-re by this ti-me Que-e-queg must cer-tain-ly ha-ve brought his Ra-ma-dan to a ter-mi-na-tion But no the-re he was just whe-re  had left him he had not stir-red an inch  be-gan to grow ve-xed with him it see-med so down-right sen-se-less and in-sa-ne to be sit-ting the-re all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room hol-ding a pie-ce of wood on his head For hea-vens sa-ke Que-e-queg get up and sha-ke yo-ur-self get up and ha-ve so-me sup-per Yo-ull star-ve yo-ull kill yo-ur-self Que-e-queg But not a word did he re-ply Des-pai-ring of him the-refo-re  de-ter-mi-ned to go to bed and to sleep and no doubt be-fo-re a great whi-le he would fol-low me But pre-vio-us to tur-ning in  took my hea-vy bears-kin jac-ket and threw it o-ver him as it pro-mi-sed to be a ve-ry cold night and he had not-hing but his or-di-na-ry round jac-ket on For so-me ti-me do all  would  could not get in-to the fain-test do-ze  had blown out the can-dle and the me-re thought of Que-e-que-gnot four feet off-sit-ting the-re in that u-nea-sy po-si-tion stark a-lo-ne in the cold and dark this ma-de me real-ly wretc-hed Think of it slee-ping all night in the sa-me room with a wi-de a-wa-ke pa-gan on his hams in this drea-ry u-nac-coun-ta-ble Ra-ma-dan But so-me-how  drop-ped off at last and knew not-hing mo-re till break of day when loo-king o-ver the be-dsi-de the-re squat-ted Que-e-queg as if he had been scre-wed down to the floor But as soon as the first glim-pse of sun en-te-red the win-dow up he got with stiff and gra-ting joints but with a cheer-ful look lim-ped to-wards me whe-re  lay pres-sed his fo-re-head a-gain a-gainst mi-ne and said his Ra-ma-dan was o-ver Now as  be-fo-re hin-ted  ha-ve no ob-jec-tion to a-ny per-sons re-li-gion be it what it may so long as that per-son does not kill or in-sult a-ny ot-her per-son be-cau-se that ot-her per-son dont be-lie-ve it al-so But when a mans re-li-gion be-co-mes real-ly fran-tic when it is a po-si-ti-ve tor-ment to him and in fi-ne ma-kes this earth of ours an un-com-for-ta-ble inn to lod-ge in then  think it high ti-me to ta-ke that in-di-vi-dual a-si-de and ar-gue the point with him  just so  now did with Que-e-queg Que-e-queg said  get in-to bed now and lie and lis-ten to me  then went on be-gin-ning with the ri-se and pro-gress of the pri-mi-ti-ve re-li-gions and co-ming down to the va-rio-us re-li-gions of the pre-sent ti-me du-ring which ti-me  la-bo-red to show Que-e-queg that all the-se Lents Ra-ma-dans and pro-lon-ged hams-quat-tings in cold cheer-less rooms we-re stark non-sen-se bad for the health u-se-less for the soul op-po-sed in short to the o-bvio-us laws of Hy-gie-ne and com-mon sen-se  told him too that he being in ot-her things such an ex-tre-me-ly sen-si-ble and sa-ga-cio-us sa-va-ge it pai-ned me ve-ry ba-dly pai-ned me to see him now so de-plo-ra-bly foo-lish a-bout this ri-di-cu-lous Ra-ma-dan of his Be-si-des ar-gued  fas-ting ma-kes the bo-dy ca-ve in hen-ce the spi-rit ca-ves in and all thoughts born of a fast must ne-ces-sa-ri-ly be halfs-tar-ved This is the rea-son why most dys-pep-tic re-li-gio-nists che-rish such me-lanc-ho-ly no-tions a-bout their he-reaf-ters  o-ne word Que-e-queg said  rat-her di-gres-si-ve-ly hell is an i-dea first born on an un-di-ges-ted ap-ple-dum-pling and sin-ce then per-pe-tua-ted through the he-re-di-ta-ry dys-pe-psias nur-tu-red by Ra-ma-dans  then as-ked

a great feast gi-ven by his fat-her the king on the gai-ning of a great bat-tle whe-rein fif-ty of the e-ne-my had been kil-led by a-bout two o-clock in the af-ter-noon and all coo-ked and ea-ten that ve-ry e-ve-ning No mo-re Que-e-queg said  shud-de-ring that will do for  knew the in-fe-ren-ces wit-hout his furt-her hin-ting them  had seen a sai-lor who had vi-si-ted that ve-ry i-sland and he told me that it was the cus-tom when a great bat-tle had been gai-ned the-re to bar-be-cue all the slain in the yard or gar-den of the vic-tor and then o-ne by o-ne they we-re pla-ced in great woo-den trenc-hers and gar-nis-hed round li-ke a pi-lau with brea-dfruit and co-coa-nuts and with so-me par-sley in their mouths we-re sent round with the vic-tors com-pli-ments to all his friends just as though the-se pre-sents we-re so ma-ny Chris-tmas tur-keys After all  do not think that my re-marks a-bout re-li-gion ma-de much im-pres-sion u-pon Que-e-queg Be-cau-se in the first pla-ce he so-me-how see-med dull of hea-ring on that im-por-tant sub-ject un-less con-si-de-red from his own point of view and in the se-cond pla-ce he did not mo-re than o-ne third un-ders-tand me couch my i-deas sim-ply as  would and fi-nal-ly he no doubt thought he knew a good deal mo-re a-bout the true re-li-gion than  did He loo-ked at me with a sort of con-des-cen-ding con-cern and com-pas-sion as though he thought it a great pi-ty that such a sen-si-ble yo-ung man should be so ho-pe-les-sly lost to e-van-ge-li-cal pa-gan pie-ty  last we ro-se and dres-sed and Que-e-queg ta-king a

my com-ra-de an-xio-us to see whet-her the stran-ger would turn the sa-me cor-ner that we did He did and then it see-med to me that he was dog-ging us but with what in-tent  could not for the li-fe of

Eli-jah was real-ly dog-ging us or not and with that in-tent cros-sed the way with Que-e-queg and on that si-de of it re-tra-ced our steps But Eli-jah pas-sed on wit-hout see-ming to no-ti-ce us This re-lie-ved me and on-ce mo-re and fi-nal-ly as it see-med to me  pro-noun-ced him in my heart a hum-bug  day or two pas-sed and the-re was great ac-ti-vi-ty a-board the Pe-quod Not on-ly we-re the old

as-ho-re till the last But it seems they al-ways gi-ve ve-ry long no-ti-ce in the-se ca-ses and the ship did not sail for se-ve-ral days But no won-der the-re was a good deal to be do-ne and the-re is

it was star-tling to see this ex-cel-lent hear-ted Qua-ke-ress co-ming on board as she did the last day with a long oil-la-dle in o-ne hand and a still lon-ger wha-ling lan-ce in the ot-her Nor was Bil-dad him-self nor Cap-tain Pe-leg at all bac-kward  for Bil-dad he car-ried a-bout with him a long list of the ar-ti-cles nee-ded and at e-ve-ry fresh ar-ri-val down went his mark op-po-si-te that

But when a man sus-pects a-ny wrong it so-me-ti-mes hap-pens that if he be al-rea-dy in-vol-ved in the mat-ter he in-sen-si-bly stri-ves to co-ver up his sus-pi-cions e-ven from him-self  much this

Cap-tain Pe-leg and Cap-tain Bil-dad we-re going it with a high hand on the quar-ter-deck just as if they we-re to be joint-com-man-ders at sea as well as to all ap-pea-ran-ces in port  as for Cap-tain Ahab no sign of him was yet to be seen on-ly they said he was in the ca-bin But then the i-dea was that his pre-sen-ce was by no means ne-ces-sa-ry in get-ting the ship un-der weigh and stee-ring her well out to sea Indeed as that was not at all his pro-per bu-si-ness but the pi-lots and as he was not yet com-ple-te-ly re-co-ve-re-dso they saidt-he-refo-re Cap-tain Ahab stay-ed be-low  all this see-med na-tu-ral e-nough es-pe-cial-ly as in the merc-hant ser-vi-ce ma-ny cap-tains ne-ver show them-sel-ves on deck for a con-si-de-ra-ble ti-me af-ter hea-ving up the anc-hor but

sup-ply yo-ur kings and que-ens with co-ro-na-tion stuff The chief ma-te of the Pe-quod was Star-buck a na-ti-ve of Nan-tuc-ket and a Qua-ker by des-cent He was a long ear-nest man and though born on an i-cy coast see-med well a-dap-ted to en-du-re hot la-ti-tu-des his flesh being hard as twi-ce-ba-ked bis-cuit Trans-por-ted to the Indies his li-ve blood would not spoil li-ke bot-tled a-le He must ha-ve been born in so-me ti-me of ge-ne-ral drought and fa-mi-ne or u-pon o-ne of tho-se fast days for which his sta-te is fa-mous Only so-me thir-ty a-rid sum-mers had he seen tho-se sum-mers had dried up all his phy-si-cal su-per-fluo-u-sness But this his thin-ness so to speak see-med no mo-re the to-ken of was-ting an-xie-ties and ca-res than it see-med the in-di-ca-tion of a-ny bo-di-ly blight  was me-re-ly the con-den-sa-tion of the man He was by no means ill-loo-king qui-te the con-tra-ry His pu-re tight skin was an ex-cel-lent fit and clo-se-ly wrap-ped up in it and em-bal-med with in-ner health and strength li-ke a re-vi-vi-fied Egyp-tian this Star-buck see-med pre-pa-red to en-du-re for long a-ges to co-me and to en-du-re al-ways as now for be it Po-lar snow or tor-rid sun li-ke a pa-tent chro-no-me-ter his in-te-rior vi-ta-li-ty was war-ran-ted to do well in all cli-ma-tes Loo-king in-to his ey-es yo-u see-med to see the-re the yet lin-ge-ring i-ma-ges of tho-se thou-san-dfold pe-rils he had calm-ly con-fron-ted through li-fe  staid stea-dfast man who-se li-fe for the most part was a tel-ling pan-to-mi-me of ac-tion and not a ta-me chap-ter of sounds Yet for all his har-dy so-brie-ty and for-ti-tu-de the-re we-re cer-tain qua-li-ties in him which at ti-mes af-fec-ted and in so-me ca-ses see-med well nigh to o-ver-ba-lan-ce all the rest Uncom-mon-ly cons-cien-tio-us for a sea-man and en-dued with a deep na-tu-ral re-ve-ren-ce the wild wa-te-ry lo-ne-li-ness of his li-fe did the-refo-re stron-gly in-cli-ne him to su-pers-ti-tion but to that sort of su-pers-ti-tion which in so-me or-ga-ni-za-tions seems rat-her to spring so-me-how from in-tel-li-gen-ce than from i-gno-ran-ce Ou-tward por-tents and in-ward pre-sen-ti-ments we-re his  if at

in the mo-re pe-ri-lous vi-cis-si-tu-des of the fis-he-ry  will ha-ve no man in my boat said Star-buck who is not a-fraid of a wha-le By this he see-med to mean not on-ly that the most re-lia-ble and u-se-ful cou-ra-ge was that which a-ri-ses from the fair es-ti-ma-tion of the en-coun-te-red pe-ril but that an ut-ter-ly fear-less man is a far mo-re dan-ge-rous com-ra-de than a co-ward Ay-e ay-e said Stubb the se-cond ma-te Star-buck the-re is as ca-re-ful a man as yo-ull find a-nyw-he-re in this fis-he-ry But we shall e-re long see what that word ca-re-ful pre-ci-se-ly means when u-sed by a man li-ke Stubb or al-most a-ny ot-her wha-le hun-ter Star-buck was no cru-sa-der af-ter pe-rils in him cou-ra-ge was not a sen-ti-ment but a thing sim-ply u-se-ful to him and al-ways at hand u-pon all mor-tal-ly prac-ti-cal oc-ca-sions Be-si-des he thought per-haps that in this bu-si-ness of wha-ling cou-ra-ge was o-ne of the great sta-ple ou-tfits of the ship li-ke her beef and her bread and not to be foo-lis-hly was-ted Whe-refo-re he had no fan-cy for lo-we-ring for wha-les af-ter sun-down nor for per-sis-ting in figh-ting a fish that too much per-sis-ted in figh-ting him For thought Star-buck  am he-re in this cri-ti-cal o-cean to kill wha-les for my li-ving and not to be kil-led by them for theirs and that hun-dreds of men had been so kil-led Star-buck well knew What doom was his own fat-hers Whe-re in the bot-tom-less deeps could he find the torn limbs of his brot-her With me-mo-ries li-ke the-se in him and mo-reo-ver gi-ven to a cer-tain su-pers-ti-tio-u-sness as has been said the cou-ra-ge of this Star-buck which could ne-vert-he-less still flou-rish must in-deed ha-ve been ex-tre-me But it was not in rea-so-na-ble na-tu-re that a man so or-ga-ni-zed and with such ter-ri-ble ex-pe-rien-ces and re-mem-bran-ces as he had it was not in na-tu-re that the-se things should fail in la-ten-tly en-gen-de-ring an e-le-ment in him which un-der sui-ta-ble cir-cums-tan-ces would break out from its con-fi-ne-ment and burn all his cou-ra-ge up  bra-ve as he might be it was that sort of bra-ve-ry chie-fly vi-si-ble in so-me in-tre-pid men which whi-le ge-ne-ral-ly a-bi-ding firm in the con-flict with seas or winds or wha-les or a-ny of the or-di-na-ry ir-ra-tio-nal hor-rors of the world yet can-not withs-tand tho-se mo-re ter-ri-fic be-cau-se mo-re spi-ri-tual ter-rors which so-me-ti-mes me-na-ce yo-u from the con-cen-tra-ting brow of an en-ra-ged and migh-ty man But we-re the co-ming nar-ra-ti-ve to re-veal in a-ny ins-tan-ce the com-ple-te a-ba-se-ment of poor Star-bucks for-ti-tu-de scar-ce might  ha-ve the heart to wri-te it for it is a thing most sor-row-ful nay shoc-king to ex-po-se the fall of va-lour in the soul Men may seem de-tes-ta-ble as joint stock-com-pa-nies and na-tions kna-ves fools and mur-de-rers the-re may be men may ha-ve mean and mea-gre fa-ces but man in the i-deal is so no-ble and so spar-kling such a

joi-ner en-ga-ged for the ye-ar Good-hu-mo-red ea-sy and ca-re-less he pre-si-ded o-ver his wha-le-boat as if the most dea-dly en-coun-ter we-re but a din-ner and his crew all in-vi-ted guests He was as par-ti-cu-lar a-bout the com-for-ta-ble ar-ran-ge-ment of his part of the boat as an old sta-ge-dri-ver is a-bout the snu-gness of his box When clo-se to the wha-le in the ve-ry deat-hlock of the

them-sel-ves the-re a-bout so-met-hing which he would find out when he o-bey-ed the or-der and not soo-ner What per-haps with ot-her things ma-de Stubb such an ea-sy-going un-fea-ring man so chee-ri-ly trud-ging off with the bur-den of li-fe in a world full of gra-ve pe-dlars all bo-wed to the ground with their packs what hel-ped to bring a-bout that al-most im-pio-us good-hu-mor of his that thing must ha-ve been his pi-pe For li-ke his no-se his short black lit-tle pi-pe was o-ne of the re-gu-lar fea-tu-res of his fa-ce Yo-u would al-most as soon ha-ve ex-pec-ted him to turn out of

out in suc-ces-sion ligh-ting o-ne from the ot-her to the end of the chap-ter then loa-ding them a-gain to be in rea-di-ness a-new For when Stubb dres-sed ins-tead of first put-ting his legs in-to his trow-sers he put his pi-pe in-to his mouth  say this con-ti-nual smo-king must ha-ve been o-ne cau-se at least of his pe-cu-liar dis-po-si-tion for e-ve-ry o-ne knows that this eart-hly air whet-her

ap-pre-hen-sion Cap-tain Ahab stood u-pon his quar-ter-deck The-re see-med no sign of com-mon bo-di-ly ill-ness a-bout him nor of the re-co-ve-ry from a-ny He loo-ked li-ke a man cut a-way from the sta-ke when the fi-re has o-ver-run-nin-gly was-ted all the limbs wit-hout con-su-ming them or ta-king a-way o-ne par-ti-cle from their com-pac-ted a-ged ro-bus-tness His who-le high broad form see-med ma-de of so-lid bron-ze and sha-ped in an u-nal-te-ra-ble mould li-ke Cel-li-nis cast Per-seus Threa-ding its way out from a-mong his grey hairs and con-ti-nuing right down o-ne si-de of his taw-ny scorc-hed fa-ce and neck till it di-sap-pea-red in his clot-hing yo-u saw a slen-der ro-dli-ke mark li-vi-dly whi-tish  re-sem-bled that per-pen-di-cu-lar seam so-me-ti-mes ma-de in the straight lof-ty trunk of a great tree when the up-per ligh-tning tea-rin-gly darts down it and wit-hout wrenc-hing a sin-gle twig peels and groo-ves out the bark from top to bot-tom e-re run-ning off in-to the soil lea-ving the tree still green-ly a-li-ve but bran-ded Whet-her that mark was born with him or whet-her it was the scar left by so-me des-pe-ra-te wound no o-ne could cer-tain-ly say By so-me ta-cit con-sent throug-hout the voy-a-ge lit-tle or no al-lu-sion was ma-de to it es-pe-cial-ly by the ma-tes But on-ce Tash-te-gos se-nior an old Gay-Head Indian a-mong the crew su-pers-ti-tio-u-sly as-ser-ted that not till he was full for-ty ye-ars old did Ahab be-co-me that way bran-ded and then it ca-me u-pon him not in the fu-ry of a-ny mor-tal fray but in an e-le-men-tal stri-fe at sea Yet this wild hint see-med in-fe-ren-tial-ly ne-ga-ti-ved by what a grey Man-xman in-si-nua-ted an old se-pulc-hral man who ha-ving ne-ver be-fo-re sai-led out of Nan-tuc-ket had ne-ver e-re this laid ey-e u-pon wild Ahab Ne-vert-he-less the old sea-tra-di-tions the im-me-mo-rial cre-du-li-ties po-pu-lar-ly in-ves-ted this old Man-xman with pre-ter-na-tu-ral po-wers of dis-cern-ment So that no whi-te sai-lor se-rio-u-sly con-tra-dic-ted him when he said that if e-ver Cap-tain Ahab should be tran-quil-ly laid outw-hich might har-dly co-me to pass so he mut-te-redt-hen whoe-ver should do that last of-fi-ce for the dead would find a birt-hmark on him from crown to so-le So po-wer-ful-ly did the who-le grim as-pect of Ahab af-fect me and the li-vid brand which strea-ked it that for the first few mo-ments  har-dly no-ted that not a lit-tle of this o-ver-bea-ring grim-ness was o-wing to the bar-ba-ric whi-te leg u-pon which he par-tly stood  had pre-vio-u-sly co-me to me that this i-vo-ry leg had at sea been fas-hio-ned from the po-lis-hed bo-ne of the sperm wha-les jaw Ay-e he was di-smas-ted off Ja-pan said the old Gay-Head Indian on-ce but li-ke his di-smas-ted craft he ship-ped a-not-her mast wit-hout co-ming ho-me for it He has a qui-ver of em  was struck with the sin-gu-lar pos-tu-re he main-tai-ned Upon each si-de of the Pe-quods quar-ter deck and pret-ty clo-se to the miz-zen shrouds the-re was an au-ger ho-le bo-red a-bout half an inch or so in-to the plank His bo-ne leg stea-died in that ho-le o-ne arm e-le-va-ted and hol-ding by a shroud Cap-tain Ahab stood e-rect loo-king straight out bey-ond the ships e-ver-pitc-hing prow The-re was an in-fi-ni-ty of fir-mest for-ti-tu-de a de-ter-mi-na-te un-sur-ren-de-ra-ble wil-ful-ness in the fi-xed and fear-less for-ward de-di-ca-tion of that glan-ce Not a word he spo-ke nor did his of-fi-cers say aught to him though by all their mi-nu-test ges-tu-res and ex-pres-sions they plain-ly sho-wed the u-nea-sy if not pain-ful cons-cio-u-sness of being un-der a trou-bled mas-te-rey-e  not on-ly that but moo-dy stric-ken Ahab stood be-fo-re them with a cru-ci-fi-xion in his fa-ce in all the na-me-less re-gal o-ver-bea-ring di-gni-ty of so-me migh-ty woe Ere long from his first vi-sit in the air he with-drew in-to his ca-bin But af-ter that mor-ning he was e-ve-ry day vi-si-ble to the crew eit-her stan-ding in his pi-vot-ho-le or sea-ted u-pon an i-vo-ry stool he had or hea-vi-ly wal-king the deck  the sky grew less gloo-my in-deed be-gan to grow a lit-tle ge-nial he be-ca-me still less and less a re-clu-se as if when the ship had sai-led from ho-me not-hing but the dead win-try blea-kness of the sea had then kept him so se-clu-ded  by and by it ca-me to pass that he was al-most con-ti-nual-ly in the air but as yet for all that he said or per-cep-ti-bly did on the at last sun-ny deck he see-med as un-ne-ces-sa-ry the-re as a-not-her mast But the Pe-quod was on-ly ma-king a pas-sa-ge now not re-gu-lar-ly crui-sing near-ly all wha-ling pre-pa-ra-ti-ves nee-ding su-per-vi-sion the ma-tes we-re ful-ly com-pe-tent to so that the-re was lit-tle or not-hing out of him-self to em-ploy or ex-ci-te Ahab now and thus cha-se a-way for that o-ne in-ter-val the clouds that lay-er u-pon lay-er we-re pi-led u-pon his brow as e-ver all clouds choo-se the lof-tiest peaks to pi-le them-sel-ves u-pon Ne-vert-he-less e-re long the warm war-bling per-sua-si-ve-ness of the plea-sant ho-li-day weat-her we ca-me to see-med gra-dual-ly to charm him from his mood For as when the redc-hee-ked dan-cing girls April and May trip ho-me to the win-try mi-sant-hro-pic woods e-ven the ba-rest rug-ge-dest most thun-der-clo-ven old oak will at least send forth so-me few green sprouts to wel-co-me such glad-hear-ted vi-si-tants so Ahab did in the end a lit-tle res-pond to the play-ful al-lu-rings of that gir-lish air Mo-re than on-ce did he put forth the faint blos-som of a look which in a-ny ot-her man would ha-ve soon flo-we-red out in a smi-le So-me days e-la-psed and i-ce and i-ce-bergs all as-tern the Pe-quod now went rol-ling through the bright Qui-to spring which at sea al-most per-pe-tual-ly reigns on the thres-hold of the e-ter-nal Au-gust of the Tro-pic The warm-ly cool clear rin-ging per-fu-med o-ver-flo-wing re-dun-dant days we-re as crys-tal go-blets of Per-sian sher-bet hea-ped u-pfla-ked up with ro-se-wa-ter snow The star-red and sta-te-ly nights see-med haugh-ty da-mes in je-wel-led vel-vets nur-sing at ho-me in lo-ne-ly pri-de the me-mo-ry of their a-bsent con-que-ring Earls the gol-den hel-me-ted suns For slee-ping man twas hard to choo-se be-tween such win-so-me days and such se-du-cing nights But all the witc-he-ries of that un-wa-ning weat-her did not me-re-ly lend new spells and po-ten-cies to the ou-tward world Inward they tur-ned u-pon the soul es-pe-cial-ly when the still mild hours of e-ve ca-me on then me-mo-ry shot her crys-tals as the clear i-ce most forms of noi-se-less twi-lights  all the-se sub-tle a-gen-cies mo-re and mo-re they wrought on Ahabs tex-tu-re  a-ge is al-ways wa-ke-ful as if the lon-ger lin-ked with li-fe the less man has to do with aught that looks li-ke death Among sea-com-man-ders the old grey-beards will of-te-nest lea-ve their berths to vi-sit the night-cloa-ked deck  was so with Ahab on-ly that now of la-te he see-med so much to li-ve in the o-pen air that tru-ly spea-king his vi-sits we-re mo-re to the ca-bin than from the ca-bin to the planks  feels li-ke going down in-to o-nes tomb-he would mut-ter to him-self-for an old cap-tain li-ke me to be des-cen-ding this nar-row scut-tle to go to my gra-ve-dug berth So al-most e-ve-ry twen-ty-four hours when the watc-hes of the night we-re set and the band on deck sen-ti-nel-led the slum-bers of the band be-low and when if a ro-pe was to be hau-led u-pon the fo-re-cas-tle the sai-lors flung it not ru-de-ly down as by day but with so-me cau-tio-u-sness dropt it to its pla-ce for fear of dis-tur-bing their slum-be-ring shi-pma-tes when this sort of stea-dy qui-e-tu-de would be-gin to pre-vail ha-bi-tual-ly the si-lent steer-sman would watch the ca-bins-cut-tle and e-re long the old man would e-mer-ge grip-ping at the i-ron ba-nis-ter to help his crip-pled way So-me con-si-de-ring touch of hu-ma-ni-ty was in him for at ti-mes li-ke the-se he u-sual-ly abs-tai-ned from pa-trol-ling the quar-ter-deck be-cau-se to his wea-ried ma-tes see-king re-po-se wit-hin six inc-hes of his i-vo-ry heel such would ha-ve been the re-ver-be-ra-ting crack and din of that bo-ny step that their dreams would ha-ve been on the crunc-hing teeth of sharks But on-ce the mood was on him too deep for com-mon re-gar-dings and as with hea-vy lum-ber-li-ke pa-ce he was mea-su-ring the ship from taf-frail to main-mast Stubb the old se-cond ma-te ca-me up from be-low with a cer-tain u-nas-su-red de-pre-ca-ting hu-mo-rou-sness hin-ted that if Cap-tain Ahab was plea-sed to walk the planks then no o-ne could say nay but the-re might be so-me way of muf-fling the noi-se hin-ting so-met-hing in-dis-tinc-tly and he-si-ta-tin-gly a-bout a glo-be of tow and the in-ser-tion in-to it of the i-vo-ry heel  Stubb thou didst not know Ahab then   a can-non-ball Stubb said Ahab that thou wouldst wad me that fas-hion But go thy ways  had for-got Be-low to thy nigh-tly gra-ve whe-re such as ye sleep be-tween shrouds to u-se ye to the fil-ling o-ne at last-Down dog and ken-nel Star-ting at the un-for-seen con-clu-ding ex-cla-ma-tion of the so sud-den-ly scorn-ful old man Stubb was speec-hless a mo-ment then said ex-ci-te-dly  am not u-sed to be spo-ken to that way sir  do but less than half li-ke it sir Avast grit-ted Ahab be-tween his set teeth and vio-len-tly mo-ving a-way as if to a-void so-me pas-sio-na-te temp-ta-tion No sir not yet said Stubb em-bol-de-ned  will not ta-me-ly be cal-led a dog sir Then be cal-led ten ti-mes a don-key and a mu-le and an ass and be-go-ne or  clear the world of thee  he said this Ahab a-dvan-ced u-pon him with such o-ver-bea-ring ter-rors in his as-pect that Stubb in-vo-lun-ta-ri-ly re-trea-ted  was ne-ver ser-ved so be-fo-re wit-hout gi-ving a hard blow for it mut-te-red Stubb as he found him-self des-cen-ding the ca-bins-cut-tle  ve-ry que-er Stop Stubb so-me-how now  dont well

Dough-Boy the ste-ward tell me that of a mor-ning he al-ways finds the old mans ham-mock clot-hes all rum-pled and tum-bled and the sheets down at the foot and the co-ver-lid al-most tied in-to knots

bla-zes he cal-led me ten ti-mes a don-key and pi-led a lot of jac-kas-ses on top of that He might as well ha-ve kic-ked me and do-ne with it May-be he did kick me and  didnt o-bser-ve it  was so

o-ver by day-light When Stubb had de-par-ted Ahab stood for a whi-le lea-ning o-ver the bul-warks and then as had been u-sual with him of la-te cal-ling a sai-lor of the watch he sent him be-low for his i-vo-ry stool and al-so his pi-pe Ligh-ting the pi-pe at the bin-na-cle lamp and plan-ting the stool on the weat-her si-de of the deck he sat and smo-ked  old Nor-se ti-mes the thro-nes of the

drea-med he kic-ked me with it and when  tried to kick back u-pon my soul my lit-tle man  kic-ked my leg right off  then pres-to Ahab see-med a py-ra-mid and  li-ke a bla-zing fool kept kic-king at it But what was still mo-re cu-rio-us Flas-kyo-u know how cu-rio-us all dreams a-ret-hrough all this ra-ge that  was in  so-me-how see-med to be thin-king to my-self that af-ter all it was not much of an

known that wai-ving all ar-gu-ment  ta-ke the good old fas-hio-ned ground that the wha-le is a fish and call u-pon ho-ly Jo-nah to back me This fun-da-men-tal thing set-tled the next point is in what

not to flee from the bat-tle if of-fe-red One of the wild sug-ges-tions re-fer-red to as at last co-ming to be lin-ked with the Whi-te Wha-le in the minds of the su-pers-ti-tio-u-sly in-cli-ned was the u-neart-hly con-ceit that Mo-by Dick was u-bi-qui-tous that he had ac-tual-ly been en-coun-te-red in op-po-si-te la-ti-tu-des at o-ne and the sa-me ins-tant of ti-me Nor cre-du-lous as such minds must ha-ve been was this con-ceit al-to-get-her wit-hout so-me faint show of su-pers-ti-tio-us pro-ba-bi-li-ty For as the se-crets of the cur-rents in the seas ha-ve ne-ver yet been di-vul-ged e-ven to the most e-ru-di-te re-search so the hid-den ways of the Sperm Wha-le when be-neath the sur-fa-ce re-main in great part u-nac-coun-ta-ble to his pur-suers and from ti-me to ti-me ha-ve

him-self with such vast swif-tness to the most wi-de-ly dis-tant points  is a thing well known to both Ame-ri-can and English wha-les-hips and as well a thing pla-ced u-pon aut-ho-ri-ta-ti-ve re-cord ye-ars a-go by Sco-res-by that so-me wha-les ha-ve been cap-tu-red far north in the Pa-ci-fic in who-se bo-dies ha-ve been found the barbs of har-poons dar-ted in the Green-land seas Nor is it to be gain-said that in so-me of the-se ins-tan-ces it has been de-cla-red that the in-ter-val of ti-me be-tween the two as-saults could not ha-ve ex-cee-ded ve-ry ma-ny days Hen-ce by in-fe-ren-ce it has been be-lie-ved by so-me wha-le-men that the Nor West Pas-sa-ge so long a pro-blem to man was ne-ver a pro-blem to the wha-le So that he-re in the real li-ving ex-pe-rien-ce of li-ving men the

u-bi-qui-tous but im-mor-tal for im-mor-ta-li-ty is but u-bi-qui-ty in ti-me that though gro-ves of spears should be plan-ted in his flanks he would still swim a-way un-har-med or if in-deed he should e-ver be ma-de to spout thick blood such a sight would be but a ghas-tly de-cep-tion for a-gain in u-nen-san-gui-ned bil-lows hun-dreds of lea-gues a-way his un-sul-lied jet would on-ce mo-re be seen But e-ven strip-ped of the-se su-per-na-tu-ral sur-mi-sings the-re was e-nough in the eart-hly ma-ke and in-con-tes-ta-ble cha-rac-ter of the mons-ter to stri-ke the i-ma-gi-na-tion with un-won-ted

we-re im-pel-led when a-mid the chips of che-wed boats and the sin-king limbs of torn com-ra-des they swam out of the whi-te curds of the wha-les di-re-ful wrath in-to the se-re-ne e-xas-pe-ra-ting

had das-hed at the wha-le as an Arkan-sas duel-list at his foe blin-dly see-king with a six inch bla-de to reach the fat-hom-deep li-fe of the wha-le That cap-tain was Ahab  then it was that sud-den-ly swee-ping his sic-kles-ha-ped lo-wer jaw be-neath him Mo-by Dick had rea-ped a-way Ahabs leg as a mo-wer a bla-de of grass in the field No tur-ba-ned Turk no hi-red Ve-ne-tian or Ma-lay

The Whi-te Wha-le swam be-fo-re him as the mo-no-ma-niac in-car-na-tion of all tho-se ma-li-cio-us a-gen-cies which so-me deep men feel ea-ting in them till they a-re left li-ving on with half a heart

took its ins-tant ri-se at the pre-ci-se ti-me of his bo-di-ly di-smem-ber-ment Then in dar-ting at the mons-ter kni-fe in hand he had but gi-ven loo-se to a sud-den pas-sio-na-te cor-po-ral

ho-me and for long months of days and weeks Ahab and an-guish lay stretc-hed to-get-her in o-ne ham-mock roun-ding in mid win-ter that drea-ry how-ling Pa-ta-go-nian Ca-pe then it was that his torn

seems all but cer-tain from the fact that at in-ter-vals du-ring the pas-sa-ge he was a ra-ving lu-na-tic and though un-lim-bed of a leg yet such vi-tal strength yet lur-ked in his Egyp-tian chest and

on-ly sub-ject to his per-cep-ti-bi-li-ty not to his will de-ter-mi-na-te Ne-vert-he-less so well did he suc-ceed in that dis-sem-bling that when with i-vo-ry leg he step-ped as-ho-re at last no Nan-tuc-ke-ter thought him ot-her-wi-se than but na-tu-ral-ly grie-ved and that to the quick with the ter-ri-ble ca-sual-ty which had o-ver-ta-ken him The re-port of his un-de-nia-ble de-li-rium at

pru-dent i-sle we-re in-cli-ned to har-bor the con-ceit that for tho-se ve-ry rea-sons he was all the bet-ter qua-li-fied and set on ed-ge for a pur-suit so full of ra-ge and wil-dness as the bloo-dy

u-pon the pre-sent voy-a-ge with the o-ne on-ly and al-len-gros-sing ob-ject of hun-ting the Whi-te Wha-le Had a-ny o-ne of his old ac-qua-in-tan-ces on sho-re but half drea-med of what was lur-king

which at first sight see-med to en-tan-gle his de-li-rio-us but still met-ho-di-cal sche-me But not so in the rea-li-ty per-haps Though the gre-ga-rio-us sperm wha-les ha-ve their re-gu-lar sea-sons

For the-re and then for se-ve-ral con-se-cu-ti-ve ye-ars Mo-by Dick had been pe-rio-di-cal-ly des-cried lin-ge-ring in tho-se wa-ters for aw-hi-le as the sun in its an-nual round loi-ters for a

sai-ling had per-haps been cor-rec-tly se-lec-ted by Ahab with a view to this ve-ry com-ple-xion of things Be-cau-se an in-ter-val of three hun-dred and six-ty-fi-ve days and nights was be-fo-re him an in-ter-val which ins-tead of im-pa-tien-tly en-du-ring as-ho-re he would spend in a mis-cel-la-neo-us hunt if by chan-ce the Whi-te Wha-le spen-ding his va-ca-tion in seas far re-mo-te from his

thit-her he says a-bout four o-clock in the mor-ning when we we-re a-bout o-ne hun-dred and fif-ty lea-gues from the Main of Ame-ri-ca our ship felt a ter-ri-ble shock which put our men in such cons-ter-na-tion that they could har-dly tell whe-re they we-re or what to think but e-ve-ry o-ne be-gan to pre-pa-re for death  in-deed the shock was so sud-den and vio-lent that we took it for gran-ted the ship had struck a-gainst a rock but when the a-ma-ze-ment was a lit-tle o-ver we cast the lead and soun-ded but found no ground The sud-den-ness of the shock ma-de the guns leap in their car-ria-ges and se-ve-ral of the men we-re sha-ken out of their ham-mocks Cap-tain Da-vis who lay with his head on a gun was thrown out of his ca-bin Lio-nel then goes on to im-pu-te the shock to an earth-qua-ke and seems to subs-tan-tia-te the im-pu-ta-tion by sta-ting that a great earth-qua-ke so-mew-he-re a-bout that ti-me did ac-tual-ly do great misc-hief a-long the Spa-nish land But  should not much won-der if in the dar-kness of that ear-ly hour of the mor-ning the shock was af-ter all cau-sed by an un-seen wha-le ver-ti-cal-ly bum-ping the hull from be-neath  might pro-ceed with se-ve-ral mo-re e-xam-ples o-ne way or a-not-her known to me of the great po-wer and ma-li-ce at ti-mes of the sperm wha-le  mo-re than o-ne ins-tan-ce he has been known not on-ly to cha-se the as-sai-ling boats back to their ships but to pur-sue the ship i-tself and long withs-tand all the lan-ces hur-led at him from its decks The English ship Pu-sie Hall can tell a sto-ry on that head and as for his strength let me say that the-re ha-ve been e-xam-ples whe-re the li-nes at-tac-hed to a run-ning sperm wha-le ha-ve in a calm been trans-fer-red to the ship and se-cu-red the-re the wha-le to-wing her great hull through the wa-ter as a hor-se walks off with a cart Again it is ve-ry of-ten o-bser-ved that if the sperm wha-le on-ce struck is al-lo-wed ti-me to ral-ly he then acts not so of-ten with blind ra-ge as with wil-ful de-li-be-ra-te de-signs of des-truc-tion to his pur-suers nor is it wit-hout con-vey-ing so-me e-lo-quent in-di-ca-tion of his cha-rac-ter that u-pon being at-tac-ked he will fre-quen-tly o-pen his mouth and re-tain it in that dread ex-pan-sion for se-ve-ral con-se-cu-ti-ve mi-nu-tes But  must be con-tent with on-ly o-ne mo-re and a con-clu-ding il-lus-tra-tion a re-mar-ka-ble and most si-gni-fi-cant o-ne by which yo-u will not fail to see that not on-ly is the most mar-vel-lous e-vent in this book cor-ro-bo-ra-ted by plain facts of the

Cons-tan-ti-no-ple a great sea-mons-ter was cap-tu-red in the neigh-bo-ring Pro-pon-tis or Sea of Mar-mo-ra af-ter ha-ving des-troy-ed ves-sels at in-ter-vals in tho-se wa-ters for a pe-riod of mo-re than fif-ty ye-ars  fact thus set down in subs-tan-tial his-to-ry can-not ea-si-ly be gain-said Nor is the-re a-ny rea-son it should be  what pre-ci-se spe-cies this sea-mons-ter was is not men-tio-ned But as he des-troy-ed ships as well as for ot-her rea-sons he must ha-ve been a wha-le and  am stron-gly in-cli-ned to think a sperm wha-le   will tell yo-u why For a long ti-me  fan-cied that the sperm wha-le had been al-ways un-known in the Me-di-ter-ra-nean and the deep wa-ters con-nec-ting with it Even now  am cer-tain that tho-se seas a-re not and per-haps ne-ver can be in the pre-sent cons-ti-tu-tion of things a pla-ce for his ha-bi-tual gre-ga-rio-us re-sort But furt-her in-ves-ti-ga-tions ha-ve re-cen-tly pro-ved to me that in mo-dern ti-mes the-re ha-ve been i-so-la-ted ins-tan-ces of the pre-sen-ce of the sperm wha-le in the Me-di-ter-ra-nean  am told on good aut-ho-ri-ty that on the Bar-ba-ry coast a Com-mo-do-re Da-vis of the Bri-tish na-vy found the ske-le-ton of a sperm wha-le Now as a ves-sel of war rea-di-ly pas-ses through the Dar-da-nel-les hen-ce a sperm wha-le could by the sa-me rou-te pass out of the Me-di-ter-ra-nean in-to the Pro-pon-tis  the Pro-pon-tis as far as  can learn no-ne of that pe-cu-liar subs-tan-ce cal-led brit is to be found the a-li-ment of the right wha-le But  ha-ve e-ve-ry rea-son to be-lie-ve that the food of the sperm wha-les-quid or cut-tle-fis-hlurks at the bot-tom of that sea be-cau-se lar-ge crea-tu-res but by no means the lar-gest of that sort ha-ve been found at its sur-fa-ce  then yo-u pro-per-ly put the-se

Ro-man Empe-ror must in all pro-ba-bi-li-ty ha-ve been a sperm wha-le Though con-su-med with the hot fi-re of his pur-po-se Ahab in all his thoughts and ac-tions e-ver had in view the ul-ti-ma-te cap-tu-re of Mo-by Dick though he see-med rea-dy to sa-cri-fi-ce all mor-tal in-te-rests to that o-ne pas-sion ne-vert-he-less it may ha-ve been that he was by na-tu-re and long ha-bi-tua-tion far too wed-ded to a fie-ry wha-le-mans ways al-to-get-her to a-ban-don the col-la-te-ral pro-se-cu-tion of the voy-a-ge  at least if this we-re ot-her-wi-se the-re we-re not wan-ting ot-her mo-ti-ves much mo-re in-fluen-tial with him  would be re-fi-ning too much per-haps e-ven con-si-de-ring his mo-no-ma-nia to hint that his vin-dic-ti-ve-ness to-wards the Whi-te Wha-le might ha-ve pos-si-bly ex-ten-ded i-tself in so-me de-gree to all sperm wha-les and that the mo-re mons-ters he slew by so much the mo-re he mul-ti-plied the chan-ces that each su-bse-quen-tly en-coun-te-red wha-le would pro-ve to be the ha-ted o-ne he hun-ted But if such an hy-pot-he-sis be in-deed ex-cep-tio-na-ble the-re we-re still ad-di-tio-nal con-si-de-ra-tions which though not so stric-tly ac-cor-ding with the wil-dness of his ru-ling pas-sion yet we-re by no means in-ca-pa-ble of sway-ing him To ac-com-plish his ob-ject Ahab must u-se tools and of all tools u-sed in the sha-dow of the moon men a-re most apt to get out of or-der He knew for e-xam-ple that ho-we-ver ma-gne-tic his as-cen-den-cy in so-me res-pects was o-ver Star-buck yet that as-cen-den-cy did not co-ver the com-ple-te spi-ri-tual man

bo-dy and Star-bucks coer-ced will we-re Ahabs so long as Ahab kept his ma-gnet at Star-bucks brain still he knew that for all this the chief ma-te in his soul ab-hor-red his cap-tains quest and could he would joy-ful-ly di-sin-tegra-te him-self from it or e-ven frus-tra-te it  might be that a long in-ter-val would e-la-pse e-re the Whi-te Wha-le was seen Du-ring that long in-ter-val Star-buck

that for the pre-sent the hunt should in so-me way be strip-ped of that stran-ge i-ma-gi-na-ti-ve im-pio-u-sness which na-tu-ral-ly in-ves-ted it that the full ter-ror of the voy-a-ge must be kept with-drawn in-to the obs-cu-re back-ground for few mens cou-ra-ge is proof a-gainst pro-trac-ted me-di-ta-tion un-re-lie-ved by ac-tion that when they stood their long night watc-hes his of-fi-cers and men must ha-ve so-me nea-rer things to think of than Mo-by Dick For ho-we-ver ea-ger-ly and im-pe-tuo-u-sly the sa-va-ge crew had hai-led the an-noun-ce-ment of his quest yet all sai-lors of all

sus-pen-ded for the fi-nal dash Nor was Ahab un-min-dful of a-not-her thing  ti-mes of strong e-mo-tion man-kind dis-dain all ba-se con-si-de-ra-tions but such ti-mes a-re e-va-nes-cent The per-ma-nent cons-ti-tu-tio-nal con-di-tion of the ma-nu-fac-tu-red man thought Ahab is sor-di-dness Gran-ting that the Whi-te Wha-le ful-ly in-ci-tes the hearts of this my sa-va-ge crew and play-ing round their sa-va-ge-ness e-ven breeds a cer-tain ge-ne-rous knigh-ter-ran-tism in them still whi-le for the lo-ve of it they gi-ve cha-se to Mo-by Dick they must al-so ha-ve food for their mo-re com-mon dai-ly ap-pe-ti-tes For e-ven the high lif-ted and chi-val-ric Cru-sa-ders of old ti-mes we-re not con-tent to tra-ver-se two thou-sand mi-les of land to fight for their ho-ly se-pulc-hre

ro-man-tic ob-ject too ma-ny would ha-ve tur-ned from in dis-gust  will not strip the-se men thought Ahab of all ho-pes of cas-hay-e cash They may scorn cash now but let so-me months go by and no pers-pec-ti-ve pro-mi-se of it to them and then this sa-me qui-es-cent cash all at on-ce mu-ti-nying in them this sa-me cash would soon cas-hier Ahab Nor was the-re wan-ting still a-not-her

ca-se he would not af-ter all per-haps ha-ve boar-ded her-jud-ging by his su-bse-quent con-duct on si-mi-lar oc-ca-sion-sif so it had been that by the pro-cess of hai-ling he had ob-tai-ned a

if ca-sual-ly en-coun-te-ring each ot-her in such in-hos-pi-ta-ble wilds the-se twain for the li-fe of them can-not well a-void a mu-tual sa-lu-ta-tion and stop-ping for a mo-ment to in-terc-han-ge

on-ly in-terc-han-ge hails but co-me in-to still clo-ser mo-re frien-dly and so-cia-ble con-tact  es-pe-cial-ly would this seem to be a mat-ter of cour-se in the ca-se of ves-sels ow-ned in o-ne

meets Be-si-des they would exc-han-ge the wha-ling news and ha-ve an a-gree-a-ble chat For not on-ly would they meet with all the sym-pat-hies of sai-lors but li-ke-wi-se with all the pe-cu-liar con-ge-nia-li-ties a-ri-sing from a com-mon pur-suit and mu-tual-ly sha-red pri-va-tions and pe-rils Nor would dif-fe-ren-ce of coun-try ma-ke a-ny ve-ry es-sen-tial dif-fe-ren-ce that is so long as both par-ties speak o-ne lan-gua-ge as is the ca-se with Ame-ri-cans and English Though to be su-re from the small num-ber of English wha-lers such mee-tings do not ve-ry of-ten oc-cur and when they do oc-cur the-re is too apt to be a sort of shy-ness be-tween them for yo-ur Englis-hman is rat-her re-ser-ved and yo-ur Yan-kee he does not fan-cy that sort of thing in a-ny-bo-dy but him-self Be-si-des the English wha-lers so-me-ti-mes af-fect a kind of me-tro-po-li-tan su-pe-rio-ri-ty o-ver the Ame-ri-can wha-lers re-gar-ding the long lean Nan-tuc-ke-ter with his non-des-cript pro-vin-cia-lisms as a sort of sea-pea-sant But whe-re this su-pe-rio-ri-ty in the English wha-le-men does real-ly con-sist it would be hard to say see-ing that the Yan-kees in o-ne day col-lec-ti-ve-ly kill mo-re wha-les than all the English col-lec-ti-ve-ly in ten ye-ars But this is a harm-less lit-tle foi-ble in the English wha-le-hun-ters which the Nan-tuc-ke-ter does not ta-ke much to heart pro-ba-bly be-cau-se he knows that he has a few foi-bles him-self So then we see that of all ships se-pa-ra-te-ly sai-ling the sea the wha-lers ha-ve most rea-son to be so-cia-bleand they a-re so Whe-reas so-me merc-hant ships cros-sing each ot-hers wa-ke in the midA-tlan-tic will of-ten-ti-mes pass on wit-hout so much as a sin-gle word of re-co-gni-tion mu-tual-ly cut-ting each

What does the wha-ler do when she meets a-not-her wha-ler in a-ny sort of de-cent weat-her She has a Gam a thing so ut-ter-ly un-known to all ot-her ships that they ne-ver heard of the na-me e-ven and if by chan-ce they should hear of it they on-ly grin at it and re-peat ga-meso-me stuff a-bout spou-ters and blub-ber-boi-lers and such li-ke pret-ty ex-cla-ma-tions Why it is that all

Be-cau-se in the ca-se of pi-ra-tes say  should li-ke to know whet-her that pro-fes-sion of theirs has a-ny pe-cu-liar glo-ry a-bout it  so-me-ti-mes ends in un-com-mon e-le-va-tion in-deed but on-ly

con-ti-nual-ly o-ver-flo-wed by the rip-pling clear wa-ter clear as a-ny moun-tain spring gen-tle-ment-hat bub-bling from the pumps ran a-cross the deck and pou-red i-tself out in stea-dy spouts at

sir said Steel-kilt mer-ry as a cric-ket Li-ve-ly boys li-ve-ly now  with that the pump clan-ged li-ke fif-ty fi-reen-gi-nes the men tos-sed their hats off to it and e-re long that pe-cu-liar gas-ping of the lungs was heard which de-no-tes the ful-lest ten-sion of li-fes u-tmost e-ner-gies Quit-ting the pump at last with the rest of his band the La-ke-man went for-ward all pan-ting and sat him-self down on the win-dlass his fa-ce fie-ry red his ey-es bloods-hot and wi-ping the pro-fu-se sweat from his brow Now what co-ze-ning fiend it was gen-tle-men that pos-ses-sed Ra-dney to med-dle with such

a sho-vel and re-mo-ve so-me of-fen-si-ve mat-ters con-se-quent u-pon al-lo-wing a pig to run at lar-ge Now gen-tle-men swee-ping a ships deck at sea is a pie-ce of hou-se-hold work which in all ti-mes but ra-ging ga-les is re-gu-lar-ly at-ten-ded to e-ve-ry e-ve-ning it has been known to be do-ne in the ca-se of ships ac-tual-ly foun-de-ring at the ti-me Such gen-tle-men is the

bu-si-ness is the pres-crip-ti-ve pro-vin-ce of the boys if boys the-re be a-board Be-si-des it was the stron-ger men in the Town-Ho that had been di-vi-ded in-to gangs ta-king turns at the pumps and being the most at-hle-tic sea-man of them all Steel-kilt had been re-gu-lar-ly as-si-gned cap-tain of o-ne of the gangs con-se-quen-tly he should ha-ve been freed from a-ny tri-vial bu-si-ness not

men But the-re was mo-re than this the or-der a-bout the sho-vel was al-most as plain-ly meant to sting and in-sult Steel-kilt as though Ra-dney had spat in his fa-ce Any man who has go-ne sai-lor in

de-li-be-ra-te-ly re-pea-ted his in-ten-tion not to o-bey See-ing ho-we-ver that his for-bea-ran-ce had not the sligh-test ef-fect by an aw-ful and uns-pea-ka-ble in-ti-ma-tion with his twis-ted hand he war-ned off the foo-lish and in-fa-tua-ted man but it was to no pur-po-se  in this way the two went on-ce slow-ly round the win-dlass when re-sol-ved at last no lon-ger to re-treat bet-hin-king him

ot-her cir-cums-tan-ces Steel-kilt sys-te-ma-ti-cal-ly built the plan of his re-ven-ge Du-ring the night Ra-dney had an un-sea-man-li-ke way of sit-ting on the bul-warks of the quar-ter-deck and

al-ways a fu-rio-us man it seems in a boat  now his ban-da-ged cry was to beach him on the wha-les to-pmost back Not-hing loath his bow-sman hau-led him up and up through a blin-ding foam that blent

aut-hen-tic a-bor-tions that is from a Chi-ne-se dra-wing  what sort of li-ve-ly lads with the pen-cil tho-se Chi-ne-se a-re ma-ny que-er cups and sau-cers in-form us  for the sign-pain-ters wha-les seen in the streets han-ging o-ver the shops of oil-dea-lers what shall be said of them They a-re ge-ne-ral-ly Ric-hard  wha-les with dro-me-da-ry humps and ve-ry sa-va-ge brea-kfas-ting on three or four sai-lor tarts that is wha-le-boats full of ma-ri-ners their de-for-mi-ties floun-de-ring in seas of blood and blue paint But the-se ma-ni-fold mis-ta-kes in de-pic-ting the wha-le a-re not so ve-ry sur-pri-sing af-ter all Con-si-der Most of the scien-ti-fic dra-wings ha-ve been ta-ken from the stran-ded fish and the-se a-re a-bout as cor-rect as a dra-wing of a wrec-ked ship with bro-ken back would cor-rec-tly re-pre-sent the no-ble a-ni-mal i-tself in all its un-das-hed pri-de of hull and spars Though e-lep-hants ha-ve stood for their full-lengths the li-ving Le-viat-han has ne-ver yet fair-ly floa-ted him-self for his por-trait The li-ving wha-le in his full ma-jes-ty and si-gni-fi-can-ce is on-ly to be seen at sea in un-fat-ho-ma-ble wa-ters and a-float the vast bulk of him is out of sight li-ke a launc-hed li-neof-bat-tle ship and out of that e-le-ment it is a thing e-ter-nal-ly im-pos-si-ble for mor-tal man to hoist him bo-di-ly in-to the air so as to pre-ser-ve all his migh-ty swells and un-du-la-tions  not to speak of the hig-hly pre-su-ma-ble dif-fe-ren-ce of con-tour be-tween a yo-ung suc-king wha-le and a full-grown Pla-to-nian Le-viat-han yet e-ven in the ca-se of o-ne of tho-se yo-ung suc-king wha-les hois-ted to a ships deck such is then the ou-tlan-dish eel-li-ke lim-be-red va-rying sha-pe of him that his pre-ci-se ex-pres-sion the de-vil him-self could not catch But it may be fan-cied that from the na-ked ske-le-ton of the stran-ded wha-le ac-cu-ra-te hints may be de-ri-ved touc-hing his true form Not at all For it is o-ne of the mo-re cu-rio-us things a-bout this Le-viat-han that his ske-le-ton gi-ves ve-ry lit-tle i-dea of his ge-ne-ral sha-pe Though Je-re-my Bent-hams ske-le-ton which hangs for can-de-la-bra in the li-bra-ry of o-ne of his e-xe-cu-tors cor-rec-tly con-veys the i-dea of a bur-ly-bro-wed u-ti-li-ta-rian old gen-tle-man with all Je-re-mys ot-her lea-ding per-so-nal cha-rac-te-ris-tics yet not-hing of this kind could be in-fer-red from a-ny le-viat-hans ar-ti-cu-la-ted bo-nes  fact as the great Hun-ter says the me-re ske-le-ton of the wha-le bears the sa-me re-la-tion to the ful-ly in-ves-ted and pad-ded a-ni-mal as the in-sect does to the chry-sa-lis that so roun-din-gly en-ve-lo-pes it This pe-cu-lia-ri-ty is stri-kin-gly e-vin-ced in the head as in so-me part of this book will be in-ci-den-tal-ly shown  is al-so ve-ry cu-rio-u-sly dis-play-ed in the si-de fin the bo-nes of which al-most e-xac-tly an-swer to the bo-nes of the hu-man hand mi-nus on-ly the thumb This fin has four re-gu-lar bo-ne-fin-gers

con-clu-de that the great Le-viat-han is that o-ne crea-tu-re in the world which must re-main un-pain-ted to the last True o-ne por-trait may hit the mark much nea-rer than a-not-her but no-ne can hit it with a-ny ve-ry con-si-de-ra-ble de-gree of e-xac-tness So the-re is no eart-hly way of fin-ding out pre-ci-se-ly what the wha-le real-ly looks li-ke  the on-ly mo-de in which yo-u can de-ri-ve e-ven a to-le-ra-ble i-dea of his li-ving con-tour is by going a wha-ling yo-ur-self but by so doing yo-u run no small risk of being e-ter-nal-ly sto-ve and sunk by him Whe-refo-re it seems to me yo-u had best not be too fas-ti-dio-us in yo-ur cu-rio-si-ty touc-hing this Le-viat-han  con-ne-xion with the mons-trous pic-tu-res of wha-les  am stron-gly temp-ted he-re to en-ter u-pon tho-se still

has in the Ame-ri-can fis-he-ry al-most en-ti-re-ly su-per-se-ded hemp as a ma-te-rial for wha-le-li-nes for though not so du-ra-ble as hemp it is stron-ger and far mo-re soft and e-las-tic and  will

the-se twin-tubs being so small they fit mo-re rea-di-ly in-to the boat and do not strain it so much whe-reas the Ame-ri-can tub near-ly three feet in dia-me-ter and of pro-por-tio-na-te depth ma-kes a rat-her bul-ky freight for a craft who-se planks a-re but o-ne hal-finch in thic-kness for the bot-tom of the wha-le-boat is li-ke cri-ti-cal i-ce which will bear up a con-si-de-ra-ble

the har-poon  the-se ins-tan-ces the wha-le of cour-se is shif-ted li-ke a mug of a-le as it we-re from the o-ne boat to the ot-her though the first boat al-ways ho-vers at hand to as-sist its con-sort Se-cond This ar-ran-ge-ment is in-dis-pen-sa-ble for com-mon sa-fe-tys sa-ke for we-re the lo-wer end of the li-ne in a-ny way at-tac-hed to the boat and we-re the wha-le then to run the li-ne out to the end al-most in a sin-gle smo-king mi-nu-te as he so-me-ti-mes does he would not stop the-re for the doo-med boat would in-fal-li-bly be drag-ged down af-ter him in-to the pro-fun-di-ty of the sea and in that ca-se no town-crier would e-ver find her a-gain Be-fo-re lo-we-ring the boat for the cha-se the up-per end of the li-ne is ta-ken aft from the tub and pas-sing round the log-ger-head the-re is a-gain car-ried for-ward the en-ti-re length of the boat res-ting cros-swi-se u-pon the loom or han-dle of e-ve-ry mans oar so that it jogs a-gainst his wrist in ro-wing and al-so pas-sing be-tween the men as they al-ter-na-te-ly sit at the op-po-si-te gun-wa-les to the lea-ded chocks or groo-ves in the ex-tre-me poin-ted prow of the boat whe-re a woo-den pin or ske-wer the si-ze of a com-mon quill pre-vents it from slip-ping out From the chocks it hangs in a slight fes-toon o-ver the bows and is then pas-sed in-si-de the boat a-gain and so-me ten or

is im-me-dia-te-ly con-nec-ted with the har-poon but pre-vio-us to that con-ne-xion the shor-twarp goes through sun-dry mys-ti-fi-ca-tions too te-dio-us to de-tail Thus the wha-le-li-ne folds the

pul-ling the boat up to him whi-le yet the boat was being to-wed on Soon ran-ging up by his flank Stubb firm-ly plan-ting his knee in the clum-sy cleat dar-ted dart af-ter dart in-to the flying fish at the word of com-mand the boat al-ter-na-te-ly ster-ning out of the way of the wha-les hor-ri-ble wal-low and then ran-ging up for a-not-her fling The red ti-de now pou-red from all si-des of the

straigh-te-ned it a-gain and a-gain by a few ra-pid blows a-gainst the gun-wa-le then a-gain and a-gain sent it in-to the wha-le Pull up-pull up he now cried to the bow-sman as the wa-ning wha-le re-la-xed in his wrath Pull up-clo-se to and the boat ran-ged a-long the fishs flank When reac-hing far o-ver the bow Stubb slow-ly chur-ned his long sharp lan-ce in-to the fish and kept it the-re

wal-lo-wed in his blood o-verw-rap-ped him-self in im-pe-ne-tra-ble mad boi-ling spray so that the im-pe-ril-led craft ins-tan-tly drop-ping as-tern had much a-do blin-dly to strug-gle out from that phren-sied twi-light in-to the clear air of the day  now a-ba-ting in his flur-ry the wha-le on-ce mo-re rol-led out in-to view sur-ging from si-de to si-de spa-smo-di-cal-ly di-la-ting and con-trac-ting his spout-ho-le with sharp crac-king a-go-ni-zed res-pi-ra-tions  last gush af-ter gush of clot-ted red go-re as if it had been the pur-ple lees of red wi-ne shot in-to the frigh-ted air and fal-ling back a-gain ran drip-ping down his mo-tion-less flanks in-to the sea His heart had burst Hes dead  Stubb said Dag-goo Yes both pi-pes smo-ked out and with-dra-wing his own from his mouth Stubb scat-te-red the dead as-hes o-ver the wa-ter and for a mo-ment stood though-tful-ly ey-e-ing the vast cor-pse he had ma-de  word con-cer-ning an in-ci-dent in the last chap-ter Accor-ding to the in-va-ria-ble u-sa-ge of the fis-he-ry the wha-le-boat pus-hes off from the ship with the hea-dsman or wha-le-kil-ler as tem-po-ra-ry steer-sman and the har-poo-neer or wha-le-fas-te-ner pul-ling the fo-re-most oar the o-ne known as the har-poo-nee-roar Now it needs a strong ner-vous arm to stri-ke the first i-ron in-to the fish for of-ten in what is cal-led a long dart the hea-vy im-ple-ment has to be flung to the dis-tan-ce of twen-ty or thir-ty feet But ho-we-ver pro-lon-ged and ex-haus-ting the cha-se the har-poo-neer is ex-pec-ted to pull his oar meanw-hi-le to the ut-ter-most in-deed he is ex-pec-ted to set an e-xam-ple of su-per-hu-man ac-ti-vi-ty to the rest not on-ly by in-cre-di-ble ro-wing but by re-pea-ted loud and in-tre-pid ex-cla-ma-tions and what it is to keep shou-ting at

rec-kles-sly at o-ne and the sa-me ti-me  this strai-ning baw-ling sta-te then with his back to the fish all at on-ce the ex-haus-ted har-poo-neer hears the ex-ci-ting cryS-tand up and gi-ve it to him He now has to drop and se-cu-re his oar turn round on his cen-tre half way sei-ze his har-poon from the crotch and with what lit-tle strength may re-main he es-says to pitch it so-me-how in-to the wha-le No won-der ta-king the who-le fleet of wha-le-men in a bo-dy that out of fif-ty fair chan-ces for a dart not fi-ve a-re suc-cess-ful no won-der that so ma-ny ha-pless har-poo-neers a-re ma-dly

that to ma-ny ship ow-ners wha-ling is but a lo-sing con-cern for it is the har-poo-neer that ma-kes the voy-a-ge and if yo-u ta-ke the breath out of his bo-dy how can yo-u ex-pect to find it the-re when most wan-ted Again if the dart be suc-cess-ful then at the se-cond cri-ti-cal ins-tant that is when the wha-le starts to run the boat-hea-der and har-poo-neer li-ke-wi-se start to run-ning fo-re and aft to the im-mi-nent jeo-par-dy of them-sel-ves and e-ve-ry o-ne el-se  is then they chan-ge pla-ces and the hea-dsman the chief of-fi-cer of the lit-tle craft ta-kes his pro-per sta-tion in the bows of the boat Now  ca-re not who main-tains the con-tra-ry but all this is both foo-lish and un-ne-ces-sa-ry The hea-dsman should stay in the bows from first to last he should both dart the har-poon and the lan-ce and no ro-wing wha-te-ver should be ex-pec-ted of him ex-cept un-der cir-cums-tan-ces o-bvio-us to a-ny fis-her-man  know that this would so-me-ti-mes in-vol-ve a slight loss of speed in the cha-se but long ex-pe-rien-ce in va-rio-us wha-le-men of mo-re than o-ne na-tion has con-vin-ced me that in the vast ma-jo-ri-ty of fai-lu-res in the fis-he-ry it has not by a-ny means been so much the speed of the wha-le as the be-fo-re des-cri-bed ex-haus-tion of the har-poo-neer that has cau-sed them To in-su-re the grea-test ef-fi-cien-cy in the dart the har-poo-neers of this world must start to their feet from out of i-dle-ness and not from out of toil Out of the trunk the branc-hes grow out of them the twigs So in pro-duc-ti-ve sub-jects grow the chap-ters The crotch al-lu-ded to on a pre-vio-us pa-ge de-ser-ves in-de-pen-dent men-tion  is a notc-hed stick of a pe-cu-liar form so-me two feet in length which is per-pen-di-cu-lar-ly in-ser-ted in-to the star-board

is ins-tan-tly at hand to its hur-ler who snatc-hes it up as rea-di-ly from its rest as a bac-kwoo-dsman swings his ri-fle from the wall  is cus-to-ma-ry to ha-ve two har-poons re-po-sing in the

o-ne ins-tan-tly af-ter the ot-her in-to the sa-me wha-le so that if in the co-ming drag o-ne should draw out the ot-her may still re-tain a hold  is a dou-bling of the chan-ces But it ve-ry of-ten hap-pens that o-wing to the ins-tan-ta-neo-us vio-lent con-vul-si-ve run-ning of the wha-le u-pon re-cei-ving the first i-ron it be-co-mes im-pos-si-ble for the har-poo-neer ho-we-ver ligh-tnin-gli-ke in his mo-ve-ments to pitch the se-cond i-ron in-to him Ne-vert-he-less as the se-cond i-ron is al-rea-dy con-nec-ted with the li-ne and the li-ne is run-ning hen-ce that wea-pon must at all e-vents be an-ti-ci-pa-tin-gly tos-sed out of the boat so-me-how and so-mew-he-re el-se the most ter-ri-ble jeo-par-dy would in-vol-ve all hands Tum-bled in-to the wa-ter it ac-cor-din-gly is in such ca-ses

dis-sa-tis-fac-tion or im-pa-tien-ce or des-pair see-med wor-king in him as if the sight of that dead bo-dy re-min-ded him that Mo-by Dick was yet to be slain and though a thou-sand ot-her wha-les we-re brought to his ship all that would not o-ne jot a-dvan-ce his grand mo-no-ma-niac ob-ject Ve-ry soon yo-u would ha-ve thought from the sound on the Pe-quods decks that all hands we-re pre-pa-ring to cast anc-hor in the deep for hea-vy chains a-re being drag-ged a-long the deck and thrust rat-tling out of the port-ho-les But by tho-se clan-king links the vast cor-pse i-tself not the

Min-gling their mum-blings with his own mas-ti-ca-tions thou-sands on thou-sands of sharks swar-ming round the dead le-viat-han smac-kin-gly feas-ted on its fa-tness The few slee-pers be-low in their

feat of the shark seems all but mi-ra-cu-lous How at such an ap-pa-ren-tly u-nas-sai-la-ble sur-fa-ce they con-tri-ve to gou-ge out such sym-me-tri-cal mout-hfuls re-mains a part of the u-ni-ver-sal pro-blem of all things The mark they thus lea-ve on the wha-le may best be li-ke-ned to the hol-low ma-de by a car-pen-ter in coun-ter-sin-king for a screw Though a-mid all the smo-king hor-ror and dia-bo-lism of a sea-fight sharks will be seen lon-gin-gly ga-zing up to the ships decks li-ke hun-gry dogs round a ta-ble whe-re red meat is being car-ved rea-dy to bolt down e-ve-ry kil-led man that

toug-her mo-re e-las-tic and com-pact and ran-ges from eight or ten to twel-ve and fif-teen inc-hes in thic-kness Now ho-we-ver pre-pos-te-rous it may at first seem to talk of a-ny crea-tu-res skin as

the wha-le yo-u may scra-pe off with yo-ur hand an in-fi-ni-te-ly thin trans-pa-rent subs-tan-ce so-mew-hat re-sem-bling the thin-nest shreds of i-sin-glass on-ly it is al-most as fle-xi-ble and soft as sa-tin that is pre-vio-us to being dried when it not on-ly con-tracts and thic-kens but be-co-mes rat-her hard and brit-tle  ha-ve se-ve-ral such dried bits which  u-se for marks in my wha-le-books

bo-dy of the wha-le is not so much to be re-gar-ded as the skin of the crea-tu-re as the skin of the skin so to speak for it we-re sim-ply ri-di-cu-lous to say that the pro-per skin of the tre-men-dous wha-le is thin-ner and mo-re ten-der than the skin of a new-born child But no mo-re of this Assu-ming the blub-ber to be the skin of the wha-le then when this skin as in the ca-se of a ve-ry lar-ge Sperm Wha-le will yi-eld the bulk of o-ne hun-dred bar-rels of oil and when it is con-si-de-red that in quan-ti-ty or rat-her weight that oil in its ex-pres-sed sta-te is on-ly three

their oars in a-not-her the con-ten-ding strain threa-te-ned to ta-ke them un-der But it was on-ly a few feet a-dvan-ce they sought to gain  they stuck to it till they did gain it when ins-tan-tly a

off its drip-pings that the drops fell li-ke bits of bro-ken glass on the wa-ter whi-le the wha-le bey-ond al-so ro-se to sight and on-ce mo-re the boats we-re free to fly But the fag-ged wha-le a-ba-ted his speed and blin-dly al-te-ring his cour-se went round the stern of the ship to-wing the two boats af-ter him so that they per-for-med a com-ple-te cir-cuit Mean-ti-me they hau-led mo-re

Stubb not wit-hout so-me dis-gust at the thought of ha-ving to do with so i-gno-ble a le-viat-han Wants with it said Flask coi-ling so-me spa-re li-ne in the boats bow did yo-u ne-ver hear that the ship which but on-ce has a Sperm Wha-les head hois-ted on her star-board si-de and at the sa-me ti-me a Right Wha-les on the lar-board did yo-u ne-ver hear Stubb that that ship can ne-ver af-ter-wards ca-psi-ze Why not  dont know but  heard that gam-bo-ge ghost of a Fe-dal-lah say-ing so and he seems to know all a-bout ships charms But  so-me-ti-mes think hell charm the ship to no good at last  dont half li-ke that chap Stubb Did yo-u e-ver no-ti-ce how that tusk of his is a sort of car-ved in-to a sna-kes head Stubb Sink him  ne-ver look at him at all but if e-ver  get a chan-ce of a dark

up out of sight he car-ries it coi-led a-way in his poc-ket  guess Blast him now that  think of it hes al-ways wan-ting oa-kum to stuff in-to the toes of his boots He sleeps in his boots dont he He hasnt got a-ny ham-mock but Ive seen him lay of nights in a coil of rig-ging No doubt and its be-cau-se of his cur-sed tail he coils it down do ye see in the ey-e of the rig-ging Whats the old man ha-ve so much to do with him for Stri-king up a swap or a bar-gain  sup-po-se Bar-gai-na-bout what Why do ye see the old man is hard bent af-ter that Whi-te Wha-le and the de-vil the-re is trying to co-me round him and get him to swap a-way his sil-ver watch or his soul or so-met-hing of that sort and then hell sur-ren-der Mo-by Dick Pooh Stubb yo-u a-re sky-lar-king how can Fe-dal-lah do that  dont know Flask but the de-vil is a cu-rio-us chap and a wic-ked o-ne  tell ye Why they say as how he went a saun-te-ring in-to the old flags-hip on-ce switc-hing his tail a-bout de-vi-lish ea-sy and gen-tle-man-li-ke and in-qui-ring if the old go-ver-nor was at ho-me Well he was at ho-me and as-ked the de-vil what he wan-ted The de-vil switc-hing his hoofs up and says  want John What for says the old go-ver-nor What bu-si-ness is that of yo-urs says the de-vil get-ting madI want to u-se him Ta-ke him says the go-ver-no-rand by the Lord Flask if the de-vil didnt gi-ve John the Asia-tic cho-le-ra be-fo-re he got through with him  eat this wha-le in o-ne mout-hful But look shar-paint yo-u all rea-dy the-re Well then pull a-head and lets get the wha-le a-lon-gsi-de  think  re-mem-ber so-me such sto-ry as yo-u we-re tel-ling said Flask when at last the two boats we-re slow-ly a-dvan-cing with their bur-den to-wards the ship but  cant re-mem-ber whe-re Three Spa-niards Adven-tu-res of tho-se three bloo-dy-min-ded so-la-does Did ye read it the-re Flask  guess ye did No ne-ver saw such a book heard of it though But now tell me Stubb do yo-u sup-po-se that that de-vil yo-u was spea-king of just now was the sa-me yo-u say is now on board the Pe-quod   the sa-me man that hel-ped kill this wha-le Doesnt the de-vil li-ve for e-ver who e-ver heard that the de-vil was dead Did yo-u e-ver see a-ny par-son a wea-ring mour-ning for the de-vil  if the de-vil has a latch-key to get in-to the a-dmi-rals ca-bin dont yo-u sup-po-se he can crawl in-to a port-ho-le Tell me that  Flask How old do yo-u sup-po-se Fe-dal-lah is Stubb Do yo-u see that main-mast the-re poin-ting to the ship well thats the fi-gu-re o-ne now ta-ke all the hoops in the Pe-quods hold and string a-long in a row with that mast for oughts do yo-u see well that wouldnt be-gin to be Fe-dal-lahs a-ge Nor all the coo-pers in crea-tion couldnt show hoops e-nough to ma-ke oughts e-nough But see he-re Stubb  thought yo-u a lit-tle boas-ted just now that yo-u meant to gi-ve Fe-dal-lah a sea-toss if yo-u got a good chan-ce Now if hes so old as all tho-se hoops of yo-urs co-me to and if he is going to li-ve for e-ver what good will it do to pitch him o-ver-board-tell me that Gi-ve him a good duc-king a-ny-how But hed crawl back Duck him a-gain and keep duc-king him Sup-po-se he should ta-ke it in-to his head to duck yo-u thoug-hyes and drown yo-uw-hat then  should li-ke to see him try it  gi-ve him such a pair of black ey-es that he wouldnt da-re to show his fa-ce in the a-dmi-rals ca-bin a-gain for a long whi-le let a-lo-ne down in the or-lop the-re whe-re he li-ves and he-rea-bouts on the up-per decks whe-re he sneaks so much Damn the de-vil Flask so yo-u sup-po-se  a-fraid of the de-vil Whos a-fraid of him ex-cept the old go-ver-nor who da-resnt catch him and put him in dou-ble-dar-bies as he de-ser-ves but lets him go a-bout ki-dnap-ping peo-ple ay-e and si-gned a bond with him that all the peo-ple the de-vil ki-dnap-ped hed roast for him The-res a go-ver-nor Do yo-u sup-po-se Fe-dal-lah wants to ki-dnap Cap-tain Ahab Do  sup-po-se it Yo-ull know it be-fo-re long Flask But  am going now to keep a sharp loo-kout on him and if  see a-nyt-hing ve-ry sus-pi-cio-us going on  just ta-ke him by the na-pe of his neck and say-Look he-re Beel-ze-bub yo-u dont do it and if he ma-kes a-ny fuss by the Lord  ma-ke a grab in-to his poc-ket for his tail ta-ke it to the caps-tan and gi-ve him such a wrenc-hing and hea-ving that his tail will co-me short off at the stump-do yo-u see and then  rat-her guess when he finds him-self doc-ked in that que-er fas-hion hell sneak off wit-hout the poor sa-tis-fac-tion of fee-ling his tail be-tween his legs  what will yo-u do with the tail Stubb Do with it Sell it for an ox whip when we get ho-mew-hat el-se Now do yo-u mean what yo-u say and ha-ve been say-ing all a-long Stubb Mean or not mean he-re we a-re at the ship The boats we-re he-re hai-led to tow the wha-le on the lar-board si-de whe-re flu-ke chains and ot-her ne-ces-sa-ries we-re al-rea-dy pre-pa-red for se-cu-ring him Didnt  tell yo-u so said Flask yes yo-ull soon see this right wha-les head hois-ted up op-po-si-te that par-ma-cet-tis  good ti-me Flasks say-ing pro-ved true  be-fo-re the Pe-quod stee-ply lea-ned o-ver to-wards the sperm wha-les head now by the

to-get-her our own  the grand or-der of fo-lio le-viat-hans the Sperm Wha-le and the Right Wha-le a-re by far the most no-te-wort-hy They a-re the on-ly wha-les re-gu-lar-ly hun-ted by man To the Nan-tuc-ke-ter they pre-sent the two ex-tre-mes of all the known va-rie-ties of the wha-le  the ex-ter-nal dif-fe-ren-ce be-tween them is main-ly o-bser-va-ble in their heads and as a head of each is this mo-ment han-ging from the Pe-quods si-de and as we may free-ly go from o-ne to the ot-her by me-re-ly step-ping a-cross the deckw-he-re  should li-ke to know will yo-u ob-tain a bet-ter chan-ce to stu-dy prac-ti-cal ce-to-lo-gy than he-re  the first pla-ce yo-u a-re struck by the ge-ne-ral con-trast be-tween the-se heads Both a-re mas-si-ve e-nough in all cons-cien-ce but the-re is a cer-tain mat-he-ma-ti-cal sym-me-try in the Sperm Wha-les which the Right Wha-les sa-dly lacks The-re is mo-re cha-rac-ter in the Sperm Wha-les head  yo-u be-hold it yo-u in-vo-lun-ta-ri-ly yi-eld the im-men-se su-pe-rio-ri-ty to him in point of per-va-ding di-gni-ty  the pre-sent ins-tan-ce too this di-gni-ty is heigh-te-ned by the pep-per and salt co-lour of his head at the sum-mit gi-ving to-ken of a-dvan-ced a-ge and lar-ge ex-pe-rien-ce  short he is what the fis-her-men tec-hni-cal-ly call a grey-hea-ded wha-le Let us now no-te what is least dis-si-mi-lar in the-se hea-dsna-me-ly the two most im-por-tant or-gans the ey-e and the ear Far back on the si-de of the head and low down near the an-gle of eit-her wha-les jaw if yo-u nar-row-ly search yo-u will at last see a las-hless ey-e which yo-u would fan-cy to be a yo-ung colts ey-e so out of all pro-por-tion is it to the ma-gni-tu-de of the head Now from this pe-cu-liar si-de-way po-si-tion of the wha-les ey-es it is plain that he can ne-ver see an ob-ject which is e-xac-tly a-head no mo-re than he can o-ne e-xac-tly as-tern  a word the po-si-tion of the wha-les ey-es cor-res-ponds to that of a mans ears and yo-u may fan-cy for yo-ur-self how it would fa-re with yo-u did yo-u si-de-ways sur-vey ob-jects through yo-ur ears Yo-u would find that yo-u could on-ly com-mand so-me thir-ty de-grees of vi-sion in a-dvan-ce of the straight si-de-li-ne of sight and a-bout thir-ty mo-re be-hind it  yo-ur bit-te-rest foe we-re wal-king straight to-wards yo-u with dag-ger u-plif-ted in broad day yo-u would not be a-ble to see him a-ny mo-re than if he we-re stea-ling u-pon yo-u from be-hind  a word yo-u would ha-ve two backs so to speak but at the sa-me ti-me al-so two fronts si-de fronts for what is it that ma-kes the front of a manw-hat in-deed but his ey-es Mo-reo-ver whi-le in most ot-her a-ni-mals that  can now think of the ey-es a-re so plan-ted as im-per-cep-ti-bly to blend their vi-sual po-wer so as to pro-du-ce o-ne pic-tu-re and not two to the brain the pe-cu-liar po-si-tion of the wha-les ey-es ef-fec-tual-ly di-vi-ded as they a-re by ma-ny cu-bic feet of so-lid head which to-wers be-tween them li-ke a great moun-tain se-pa-ra-ting two la-kes in val-leys this of cour-se must whol-ly se-pa-ra-te the im-pres-sions which each in-de-pen-dent or-gan im-parts The wha-le the-refo-re must see o-ne dis-tinct pic-tu-re on this si-de and a-not-her dis-tinct pic-tu-re on that si-de whi-le all be-tween must be pro-found dar-kness and not-hin-gness to him Man may in ef-fect be said to look out on the world from a sen-try-box with two joi-ned sas-hes for his win-dow But with the wha-le the-se two sas-hes a-re se-pa-ra-te-ly in-ser-ted ma-king two dis-tinct win-dows but sa-dly im-pai-ring the view This pe-cu-lia-ri-ty of the wha-les ey-es is a thing al-ways to be bor-ne in mind in the fis-he-ry and to be re-mem-be-red by the rea-der in so-me su-bse-quent sce-nes  cu-rio-us and most puz-zling ques-tion might be star-ted con-cer-ning this vi-sual mat-ter as touc-hing the Le-viat-han But  must be con-tent with a hint So long as a mans ey-es a-re o-pen in the light the act of see-ing is in-vo-lun-ta-ry that is he can-not then help mec-ha-ni-cal-ly see-ing wha-te-ver ob-jects a-re be-fo-re him Ne-vert-he-less a-ny o-nes ex-pe-rien-ce will teach him that though he can ta-ke in an un-dis-cri-mi-na-ting sweep of things at o-ne glan-ce it is qui-te im-pos-si-ble for him at-ten-ti-ve-ly and com-ple-te-ly to e-xa-mi-ne a-ny two things-ho-we-ver lar-ge or ho-we-ver smal-lat o-ne and the sa-me ins-tant of ti-me ne-ver mind if they lie si-de by si-de and touch each ot-her But if yo-u now co-me to se-pa-ra-te the-se two ob-jects and sur-round each by a cir-cle of pro-found dar-kness then in or-der to see o-ne of them in such a man-ner as to bring yo-ur mind to bear on it the ot-her will be ut-ter-ly ex-clu-ded from yo-ur con-tem-po-ra-ry cons-cio-u-sness How is it then with the wha-le True both his ey-es in them-sel-ves must si-mul-ta-neo-u-sly act but is his brain so much mo-re com-pre-hen-si-ve com-bi-ning and sub-tle than mans that he can at the sa-me mo-ment of ti-me at-ten-ti-ve-ly e-xa-mi-ne two dis-tinct pros-pects o-ne on o-ne si-de of him and the ot-her in an e-xac-tly op-po-si-te di-rec-tion  he can then is it as mar-vel-lous a thing in him as if a man we-re a-ble si-mul-ta-neo-u-sly to go through the de-mons-tra-tions of two dis-tinct pro-blems in Eu-clid Nor stric-tly in-ves-ti-ga-ted is the-re a-ny in-con-grui-ty in this com-pa-ri-son  may be but an i-dle whim but it has al-ways see-med to me that the ex-traor-di-na-ry va-cil-la-tions of mo-ve-ment dis-play-ed by so-me wha-les when be-set by three or four boats the ti-mi-di-ty and lia-bi-li-ty to que-er frights so com-mon to such wha-les  think that all this in-di-rec-tly pro-ceeds from the hel-pless per-ple-xi-ty of vo-li-tion in which their di-vi-ded and dia-me-tri-cal-ly op-po-si-te po-wers of vi-sion must in-vol-ve them But the ear of the wha-le is full as cu-rio-us as the ey-e  yo-u a-re an en-ti-re stran-ger to their ra-ce yo-u might hunt o-ver the-se two heads for hours and ne-ver dis-co-ver that or-gan The ear has no ex-ter-nal leaf wha-te-ver and in-to the ho-le i-tself yo-u can har-dly in-sert a quill so won-drou-sly mi-nu-te is it  is lod-ged a lit-tle be-hind the ey-e With res-pect to their ears this im-por-tant dif-fe-ren-ce is to be o-bser-ved be-tween the sperm wha-le and the right Whi-le the ear of the for-mer has an ex-ter-nal o-pe-ning that of the lat-ter is en-ti-re-ly and e-ven-ly co-ve-red o-ver with a mem-bra-ne so as to be qui-te im-per-cep-ti-ble from wit-hout  it not cu-rio-us that so vast a being as the wha-le should see the world through so small an ey-e and hear the thun-der through an ear which is smal-ler than a ha-res But if his ey-es we-re broad as the lens of Hersc-hels great te-les-co-pe and his ears ca-pa-cio-us as the porc-hes of cat-he-drals would that ma-ke him a-ny lon-ger of sight or shar-per of hea-ring Not at allW-hy then do yo-u try to en-lar-ge yo-ur mind Sub-ti-li-ze it Let us now with wha-te-ver le-vers and stea-men-gi-nes we ha-ve at hand cant o-ver the sperm wha-les head that it may lie bot-tom up then as-cen-ding by a lad-der to the sum-mit ha-ve a peep down the mouth and we-re it not that the bo-dy is now com-ple-te-ly se-pa-ra-ted from it with a lan-tern we might des-cend in-to the great Ken-tuc-ky Mam-moth Ca-ve of his sto-mach But let us hold on he-re by this tooth and look a-bout us whe-re we a-re What a real-ly bea-u-ti-ful and chas-te-loo-king mouth from floor to cei-ling li-ned or rat-her pa-pe-red with a glis-te-ning whi-te mem-bra-ne glos-sy as bri-dal sa-tins But co-me out now and look at this por-ten-tous lo-wer jaw which seems li-ke the long nar-row lid of an im-men-se snuff-box with the hin-ge at o-ne end ins-tead of o-ne si-de  yo-u pry it up so as to get it o-ver-head and ex-po-se its rows of teeth it seems a ter-ri-fic port-cul-lis and such a-las it pro-ves to ma-ny a poor wight in the fis-he-ry u-pon whom the-se spi-kes fall with im-pa-ling for-ce But far mo-re ter-ri-ble is it to be-hold when fat-homs down in the sea yo-u see so-me sul-ky wha-le floa-ting the-re sus-pen-ded with his pro-di-gio-us jaw so-me fif-teen feet long han-ging straight down at righ-tan-gles with his bo-dy for all the world li-ke a ships jib-boom This wha-le is not dead he is on-ly dis-pi-ri-ted out of sorts per-haps hy-poc-hon-driac and so su-pi-ne that the hin-ges of his jaw ha-ve re-la-xed lea-ving him the-re in that un-gain-ly sort of plight a re-proach to all his tri-be who must no doubt im-pre-ca-te lock-jaws u-pon him  most ca-ses this lo-wer jaw-being ea-si-ly un-hin-ged by a prac-ti-sed ar-tistis di-sen-ga-ged and hois-ted on deck for the pur-po-se of ex-trac-ting the i-vo-ry teeth and fur-nis-hing a sup-ply of that hard whi-te wha-le-bo-ne with which the fis-her-men fas-hion all sorts of cu-rio-us ar-ti-cles in-clu-ding ca-nes um-brel-las-tocks and han-dles to ri-dingw-hips With a long wea-ry hoist the jaw is drag-ged on board as if it we-re an

out of wild wood lands The-re a-re ge-ne-ral-ly for-ty-two teeth in all in old wha-les much worn down but un-de-cay-ed nor fil-led af-ter our ar-ti-fi-cial fas-hion The jaw is af-ter-wards sawn in-to slabs and pi-led a-way li-ke joists for buil-ding hou-ses Cros-sing the deck let us now ha-ve a good long look at the Right Wha-les head  in ge-ne-ral sha-pe the no-ble Sperm Wha-les head may be com-pa-red to a Ro-man warc-ha-riot es-pe-cial-ly in front whe-re it is so broa-dly roun-ded so at a broad view the Right Wha-les head bears a rat-her i-ne-le-gant re-sem-blan-ce to a gi-gan-tic gal-liot-toed shoe Two hun-dred ye-ars a-go an old Dutch voy-a-ger li-ke-ned its sha-pe to that of a shoe-ma-kers last  in this sa-me last or shoe that old wo-man of the nur-se-ry ta-le with the

it would seem that its en-ti-re a-bsen-ce as an ex-ter-nal ap-pen-da-ge must ve-ry lar-ge-ly af-fect the coun-te-nan-ce of the wha-le For as in lands-ca-pe gar-de-ning a spi-re cu-po-la mo-nu-ment or

phy-sio-gno-mi-cal view to be had of the Sperm Wha-le is that of the full front of his head This as-pect is su-bli-me  thought a fi-ne hu-man brow is li-ke the East when trou-bled with the mor-ning  the re-po-se of the pas-tu-re the cur-led brow of the bull has a touch of the grand in it Pus-hing hea-vy can-non up moun-tain de-fi-les the e-lep-hants brow is ma-jes-tic Hu-man or a-ni-mal the mys-ti-cal brow is as that great gol-den seal af-fi-xed by the Ger-man Empe-rors to their de-crees  si-gni-fies-God do-ne this day by my hand But in most crea-tu-res nay in man him-self ve-ry of-ten the brow is but a me-re strip of al-pi-ne land lying a-long the snow li-ne Few a-re the fo-re-heads which li-ke Sha-kes-pea-res or Me-lanct-hons ri-se so high and des-cend so low that the ey-es

hun-ters track the snow prints of the deer But in the great Sperm Wha-le this high and migh-ty go-dli-ke di-gni-ty in-he-rent in the brow is so im-men-se-ly am-pli-fied that ga-zing on it in that full front view yo-u feel the Dei-ty and the dread po-wers mo-re for-ci-bly than in be-hol-ding a-ny ot-her ob-ject in li-ving na-tu-re For yo-u see no o-ne point pre-ci-se-ly not o-ne dis-tinct fea-tu-re

se-mi-cres-cen-tic de-pres-sion in the fo-re-heads mid-dle which in man is La-va-ters mark of ge-nius But how Ge-nius in the Sperm Wha-le Has the Sperm Wha-le e-ver writ-ten a book spo-ken a speech No his great ge-nius is de-cla-red in his doing not-hing par-ti-cu-lar to pro-ve it  is mo-reo-ver de-cla-red in his py-ra-mi-di-cal si-len-ce  this re-minds me that had the great Sperm Wha-le been known to the yo-ung Orient World he would ha-ve been dei-fied by their chil-dma-gian thoughts They dei-fied the cro-co-di-le of the Ni-le be-cau-se the cro-co-di-le is ton-gue-less and the Sperm Wha-le has

the seat of his in-tel-li-gen-ce  is plain then that phre-no-lo-gi-cal-ly the head of this Le-viat-han in the crea-tu-res li-ving in-tact sta-te is an en-ti-re de-lu-sion  for his true brain yo-u can then see no in-di-ca-tions of it nor feel a-ny The wha-le li-ke all things that a-re migh-ty wears a fal-se brow to the com-mon world  yo-u un-load his skull of its sper-my heaps and then ta-ke a rear view of its rear end which is the high end yo-u will be struck by its re-sem-blan-ce to the hu-man skull be-held in the sa-me si-tua-tion and from the sa-me point of view Indeed pla-ce this re-ver-sed skull sca-led down to the hu-man ma-gni-tu-de a-mong a pla-te of mens skulls and yo-u would in-vo-lun-ta-ri-ly con-found it with them and re-mar-king the de-pres-sions on o-ne part of its sum-mit in

bel-ly but as tem-po-ra-ri-ly lod-ged in so-me part of his mouth  this seems rea-so-na-ble e-nough in the good Bis-hop For tru-ly the Right Wha-les mouth would ac-com-mo-da-te a cou-ple of whist-ta-bles and com-for-ta-bly seat all the play-ers Pos-si-bly too Jo-nah might ha-ve ens-con-ced him-self in a hol-low tooth but on se-cond thoughts the Right Wha-le is toot-hless Anot-her rea-son which Sag-Har-bor he went by that na-me ur-ged for his want of faith in this mat-ter of the prop-het was so-met-hing obs-cu-re-ly in re-fe-ren-ce to his in-car-ce-ra-ted bo-dy and the wha-les gas-tric jui-ces But this ob-jec-tion li-ke-wi-se falls to the ground be-cau-se a Ger-man e-xe-ge-tist sup-po-ses that Jo-nah must ha-ve ta-ken re-fu-ge in the floa-ting bo-dy of a dead wha-lee-ven as the French sol-diers in the Rus-sian cam-paign tur-ned their dead hor-ses in-to tents and craw-led in-to them Be-si-des it has been di-vi-ned by ot-her con-ti-nen-tal com-men-ta-tors that when Jo-nah was thrown o-ver-board from the Jop-pa ship he straigh-tway ef-fec-ted his es-ca-pe to a-not-her ves-sel near by so-me ves-sel with a wha-le for a fi-gu-re-head and  would add pos-si-bly cal-led The Wha-le as so-me craft a-re no-wa-days chris-te-ned the Shark the Gull the Ea-gle Nor ha-ve the-re been wan-ting lear-ned e-xe-ge-tists who ha-ve o-pi-ned that the wha-le men-tio-ned in the book of Jo-nah me-re-ly meant a li-fe-pre-ser-ve-ran in-fla-ted bag of windw-hich the en-dan-ge-red prop-het swam to and so was sa-ved from a wa-te-ry doom Poor Sag-Har-bor the-refo-re seems wors-ted all round But he had still a-not-her rea-son for his want of faith  was this if  re-mem-ber right Jo-nah was swal-lo-wed by the wha-le in the Me-di-ter-ra-nean Sea and af-ter three days he was vo-mi-ted up so-mew-he-re wit-hin three days jour-ney of Ni-ne-veh a ci-ty on the Ti-gris ve-ry much mo-re than three days jour-ney a-cross from the nea-rest point of the Me-di-ter-ra-nean coast How is that But was the-re no ot-her way for the wha-le to land the prop-het wit-hin that short dis-tan-ce of Ni-ne-veh Yes He might ha-ve car-ried him round by the way of the Ca-pe of Good Ho-pe But not to speak of the pas-sa-ge through the who-le length of the Me-di-ter-ra-nean and a-not-her pas-sa-ge up the Per-sian Gulf and Red Sea such a sup-po-si-tion would in-vol-ve the com-ple-te cir-cum-na-vi-ga-tion of all Afri-ca in three days not to speak of the Ti-gris wa-ters near the si-te of Ni-ne-veh being too shal-low for a-ny wha-le to swim in Be-si-des this i-dea of Jo-nahs weat-he-ring the Ca-pe of Good Ho-pe at so ear-ly a day would wrest the ho-nour of the dis-co-ve-ry of that great hea-dland from Bart-ho-lo-mew Diaz its re-pu-ted dis-co-ve-rer and so ma-ke mo-dern his-to-ry a liar But all the-se foo-lish ar-gu-ments of old Sag-Har-bor on-ly e-vin-ced his foo-lish pri-de of rea-so-na thing still mo-re re-pre-hen-si-ble in him see-ing that he had but lit-tle lear-ning ex-cept what he had pic-ked up from the sun and the sea  say it on-ly shows his foo-lish im-pio-us pri-de and a-bo-mi-na-ble de-vi-lish re-bel-lion a-gainst the re-ve-rend cler-gy For by a Por-tu-gue-se Cat-ho-lic priest this ve-ry i-dea of Jo-nahs going to Ni-ne-veh via the Ca-pe of Good Ho-pe was a-dvan-ced as a si-gnal ma-gni-fi-ca-tion of the ge-ne-ral mi-ra-cle  so it was Be-si-des to this day the hig-hly en-ligh-te-ned Turks de-vou-tly be-lie-ve in the his-to-ri-cal sto-ry of Jo-nah  so-me three cen-tu-ries a-go an English tra-vel-ler in old Har-riss Voy-a-ges speaks of a Tur-kish Mos-que built in ho-nour of Jo-nah in which Mos-que was a mi-ra-cu-lous lamp that burnt wit-hout a-ny oil To ma-ke them run ea-si-ly and swif-tly the a-xles of car-ria-ges a-re a-noin-ted and for much the sa-me pur-po-se so-me wha-lers per-form an a-na-lo-gous o-pe-ra-tion u-pon their boat they grea-se the bot-tom Nor is it to be doub-ted that as such a pro-ce-du-re can do no harm it may pos-si-bly be of no con-temp-ti-ble a-dvan-ta-ge con-si-de-ring that oil and wa-ter a-re hos-ti-le that oil is a sli-ding thing and that the ob-ject in view is to ma-ke the boat sli-de bra-ve-ly Que-e-queg be-lie-ved stron-gly in a-noin-ting his boat and o-ne mor-ning not long af-ter the Ger-man ship Jun-gfrau di-sap-pea-red took mo-re than cus-to-ma-ry pains in that oc-cu-pa-tion craw-ling un-der its bot-tom whe-re it hung o-ver the si-de and rub-bing in the unc-tuo-u-sness as though di-li-gen-tly see-king to in-su-re a crop of hair from the crafts bald keel He see-med to be wor-king in o-be-dien-ce to so-me par-ti-cu-lar pre-sen-ti-ment Nor did it re-main un-war-ran-ted by the e-vent To-wards noon wha-les we-re rai-sed but so soon as the ship sai-led down to them they tur-ned and fled with swift pre-ci-pi-tan-cy a di-sor-de-red flight as of Cleo-pa-tras bar-ges from Actium Ne-vert-he-less the boats pur-sued and Stubbs was fo-re-most By great e-xer-tion Tash-te-go at last suc-cee-ded in plan-ting o-ne i-ron but the stric-ken wha-le wit-hout at all soun-ding still con-ti-nued his ho-ri-zon-tal flight with ad-ded flee-tness Such u-nin-ter-mit-ted strai-nings u-pon the plan-ted i-ron must soo-ner or la-ter i-ne-vi-ta-bly ex-tract it  be-ca-me im-pe-ra-ti-ve to lan-ce the flying wha-le or be con-tent to lo-se him But to haul the boat up to his flank was im-pos-si-ble he swam so fast and fu-rio-us What then re-mai-ned  all the won-drous de-vi-ces and dex-te-ri-ties the sleights of hand and coun-tless sub-tle-ties to which the ve-te-ran wha-le-man is so of-ten for-ced no-ne ex-ceed that fi-ne ma-noe-u-vre with the lan-ce cal-led pitch-po-ling Small sword or broad sword in all its e-xer-ci-ses boasts not-hing li-ke it  is on-ly in-dis-pen-sa-ble with an in-ve-tera-te run-ning wha-le its grand fact and fea-tu-re is the won-der-ful dis-tan-ce to which the long lan-ce is ac-cu-ra-te-ly dar-ted from a vio-len-tly roc-king jer-king boat un-der ex-tre-me hea-dway Steel and wood in-clu-ded the en-ti-re spear is so-me ten or twel-ve feet in length the staff is much sligh-ter than that of the har-poon and al-so of a ligh-ter ma-te-rial-pi-ne  is fur-nis-hed with a small ro-pe cal-led a warp of con-si-de-ra-ble length by which it can be hau-led back to the hand af-ter dar-ting But be-fo-re going furt-her it is im-por-tant to men-tion he-re that though the har-poon may be pitch-po-led in the sa-me way with the lan-ce yet it is sel-dom do-ne and when do-ne is still less fre-quen-tly suc-cess-ful on ac-count of the grea-ter weight and in-fe-rior length of the har-poon as com-pa-red with the lan-ce which in ef-fect be-co-me se-rio-us draw-backs  a ge-ne-ral thing the-refo-re yo-u must first get fast to a wha-le be-fo-re a-ny pitch-po-ling co-mes in-to

stands u-pright in the tos-sed bow of the flying boat wrapt in flee-cy foam the to-wing wha-le is for-ty feet a-head Han-dling the long lan-ce ligh-tly glan-cing twi-ce or thri-ce a-long its length to see if it be e-xac-tly straight Stubb whis-tlin-gly gat-hers up the coil of the warp in o-ne hand so as to se-cu-re its free end in his grasp lea-ving the rest u-nobs-truc-ted Then hol-ding the lan-ce full be-fo-re his waist-bands mid-dle he le-vels it at the wha-le when co-ve-ring him with it he stea-di-ly de-pres-ses the but-tend in his hand the-re-by e-le-va-ting the point till the wea-pon stands fair-ly ba-lan-ced u-pon his palm fif-teen feet in the air He minds yo-u so-mew-hat of a jug-gler ba-lan-cing a long staff on his chin Next mo-ment with a ra-pid na-me-less im-pul-se in a su-perb lof-ty arch the bright steel spans the foa-ming dis-tan-ce and qui-vers in the li-fe spot of the wha-le Instead of spar-kling wa-ter he now spouts red blood That dro-ve the spi-got out of him cried Stubb Tis Ju-lys im-mor-tal Fourth all foun-tains must run wi-ne to-day Would now it we-re old Orleans whis-key or old Ohio or uns-pea-ka-ble old Mo-non-ga-he-la Then Tash-te-go lad  ha-ve ye hold a ca-na-kin to the jet and wed drink round it Ye-a ve-ri-ly hearts a-li-ve wed brew choi-ce punch in the spread of his spout-ho-le the-re and from that li-ve punch-bowl quaff the li-ving stuff Again and a-gain to such ga-meso-me talk the dex-te-rous dart is re-pea-ted the spear re-tur-ning to its mas-ter li-ke a grey-hound held in skil-ful leash The a-go-ni-zed wha-le goes in-to his flur-ry the tow-li-ne is slac-ke-ned and the pitch-po-ler drop-ping as-tern folds his hands and mu-te-ly watc-hes the mons-ter die That for six thou-sand ye-ar-sand no o-ne knows how ma-ny mil-lions of a-ges be-fo-ret-he great wha-les should ha-ve been spou-ting all o-ver the sea and sprin-kling and mis-ti-fying the gar-dens of the deep as with so ma-ny sprin-kling or mis-ti-fying pots and that for so-me cen-tu-ries back thou-sands of hun-ters should ha-ve been clo-se by the foun-tain of the wha-le watc-hing the-se sprin-klings and spou-tingst-hat all this should be and yet that down to this bles-sed mi-nu-te fif-teen and a quar-ter mi-nu-tes past o-ne o-clock  of this six-teenth day of De-cem-ber  it should still re-main a pro-blem whet-her the-se spou-tings a-re af-ter all real-ly wa-ter or not-hing but va-pourt-his is su-re-ly a no-te-wort-hy thing Let us then look at this mat-ter a-long with so-me in-te-res-ting i-tems con-tin-gent Eve-ry o-ne knows that by the pe-cu-liar cun-ning of their gills the fin-ny tri-bes in ge-ne-ral breat-he the air which at all ti-mes is com-bi-ned with the e-le-ment in which they swim hen-ce a her-ring or a cod might li-ve a cen-tu-ry and ne-ver on-ce rai-se its head a-bo-ve the sur-fa-ce But o-wing to his mar-ked in-ter-nal struc-tu-re which gi-ves him re-gu-lar lungs li-ke a hu-man beings the wha-le can on-ly li-ve by in-ha-ling the di-sen-ga-ged air in the o-pen a-tmosp-he-re Whe-refo-re the ne-ces-si-ty for his pe-rio-di-cal vi-sits to the up-per world But he can-not in a-ny de-gree breat-he through his mouth for in his or-di-na-ry at-ti-tu-de the Sperm Wha-les mouth is bu-ried at least eight feet be-neath the sur-fa-ce and what is still mo-re his wind-pi-pe has no con-ne-xion with his mouth No he breat-hes through his spi-ra-cle a-lo-ne and this is on the top of his head   say that in a-ny crea-tu-re breat-hing is on-ly a func-tion in-dis-pen-sa-ble to vi-ta-li-ty i-na-smuch as it with-draws from the air a cer-tain e-le-ment which being su-bse-quen-tly brought in-to con-tact with the blood im-parts to the blood its vi-vi-fying prin-ci-ple  do not think  shall err though  may pos-si-bly u-se so-me su-per-fluo-us scien-ti-fic words Assu-me it and it fol-lows that if all the blood in a man could be ae-ra-ted with o-ne breath he might then seal up his nos-trils and not fetch a-not-her for a con-si-de-ra-ble ti-me That is to say he would then li-ve wit-hout breat-hing Ano-ma-lous as it may seem this is pre-ci-se-ly the ca-se with the wha-le who sys-te-ma-ti-cal-ly li-ves by in-ter-vals his full hour and mo-re when at the bot-tom wit-hout dra-wing a sin-gle breath or so much as in a-ny way in-ha-ling a par-ti-cle of air for re-mem-ber he has no gills How is this Be-tween his ribs and on each si-de of his spi-ne he is sup-plied with a re-mar-ka-ble in-vol-ved Cre-tan la-by-rinth of ver-mi-cel-li-li-ke ves-sels which ves-sels when he quits the sur-fa-ce a-re com-ple-te-ly dis-ten-ded with o-xy-ge-na-ted blood So that for an hour or mo-re a thou-sand fat-homs in the sea he car-ries a sur-plus stock of vi-ta-li-ty in him just as the ca-mel cros-sing the wa-ter-less de-sert car-ries a sur-plus sup-ply of drink for fu-tu-re u-se in its four sup-ple-men-ta-ry sto-machs The a-na-to-mi-cal fact of this la-by-rinth is in-dis-pu-ta-ble and that the sup-po-si-tion foun-ded u-pon it is rea-so-na-ble and true seems the mo-re co-gent to me when  con-si-der the ot-her-wi-se i-nex-pli-ca-ble obs-ti-na-cy of that le-viat-han in ha-ving his spou-tings out as the fis-her-men phra-se it This is what  mean  un-mo-les-ted u-pon ri-sing to the sur-fa-ce the Sperm Wha-le will con-ti-nue the-re for a pe-riod of ti-me e-xac-tly u-ni-form with all his ot-her un-mo-les-ted ri-sings Say he stays e-le-ven mi-nu-tes and jets se-ven-ty ti-mes that is respi-res se-ven-ty breaths then whe-ne-ver he ri-ses a-gain he will be su-re to ha-ve his se-ven-ty breaths o-ver a-gain to a mi-nu-te Now if af-ter he fetc-hes a few breaths yo-u a-larm him so that he sounds he will be al-ways dod-ging up a-gain to ma-ke good his re-gu-lar al-lo-wan-ce of air  not till tho-se se-ven-ty breaths a-re told will he fi-nal-ly go down to stay out his full term be-low Re-mark ho-we-ver that in dif-fe-rent in-di-vi-duals the-se ra-tes a-re dif-fe-rent but in a-ny o-ne they a-re a-li-ke Now why should the wha-le thus in-sist u-pon ha-ving his spou-tings out un-less it be to re-ple-nish his re-ser-voir of air e-re des-cen-ding for good How o-bvio-us is it too that this ne-ces-si-ty for the wha-les ri-sing ex-po-ses him to all the fa-tal ha-zards of the cha-se For not by hook or by net could this vast le-viat-han be caught when sai-ling a thou-sand fat-homs be-neath the sun-light Not so much thy skill then  hun-ter as the great ne-ces-si-ties that stri-ke the vic-to-ry to thee  man breat-hing is in-ces-san-tly going o-no-ne breath on-ly ser-ving for two or three pul-sa-tions so that wha-te-ver ot-her bu-si-ness he has to at-tend to wa-king or slee-ping breat-he he must or die he will But the Sperm Wha-le on-ly breat-hes a-bout o-ne se-venth or Sun-day of his ti-me  has been said that the wha-le on-ly breat-hes through his spout-ho-le if it could trut-hful-ly be ad-ded that his spouts a-re mi-xed with wa-ter then  o-pi-ne we should be fur-nis-hed with the rea-son why his sen-se of smell seems o-bli-te-ra-ted in him for the on-ly thing a-bout him that at all an-swers to his no-se is that i-den-ti-cal spout-ho-le and being so clog-ged with two e-le-ments it could not be ex-pec-ted to ha-ve the po-wer of smel-ling But o-wing to the mys-te-ry of the spoutw-het-her it be wa-ter or whet-her it be va-pour-no a-bso-lu-te cer-tain-ty can as yet be ar-ri-ved at on this head Su-re it is ne-vert-he-less that the Sperm Wha-le has no pro-per ol-fac-to-ries But what does he want of them No ro-ses no vio-lets no Co-lo-gne-wa-ter in the sea Furt-her-mo-re as his wind-pi-pe so-le-ly o-pens in-to the tu-be of his spou-ting ca-nal and as that long ca-nal-li-ke the grand Erie Ca-na-lis fur-nis-hed with a sort of locks that o-pen and shut for the down-ward re-ten-tion of air or the u-pward ex-clu-sion of wa-ter the-refo-re the wha-le has no voi-ce un-less yo-u in-sult him by say-ing that when he so stran-ge-ly rum-bles he talks through his no-se But then a-gain what has the wha-le to say Sel-dom ha-ve  known a-ny pro-found being that had a-nyt-hing to say to this world un-less for-ced to stam-mer out so-met-hing by way of get-ting a li-ving  hap-py that the world is such an ex-cel-lent lis-te-ner Now the spou-ting ca-nal of the Sperm Wha-le chie-fly in-ten-ded as it is for the con-vey-an-ce of air and for se-ve-ral feet laid a-long ho-ri-zon-tal-ly just be-neath the up-per sur-fa-ce of his head and a lit-tle to o-ne si-de this cu-rio-us ca-nal is ve-ry much li-ke a gas-pi-pe laid down in a ci-ty on o-ne si-de of a street But the ques-tion re-turns whet-her this gas-pi-pe is al-so a wa-ter-pi-pe in ot-her words whet-her the spout of the Sperm Wha-le is the me-re va-pour of the ex-ha-led breath or whet-her that ex-ha-led breath is mi-xed with wa-ter ta-ken in at the mouth and disc-har-ged through the spi-ra-cle  is cer-tain that the mouth in-di-rec-tly com-mu-ni-ca-tes with the spou-ting ca-nal but it can-not be pro-ved that this is for the pur-po-se of disc-har-ging wa-ter through the spi-ra-cle Be-cau-se the grea-test ne-ces-si-ty for so doing would seem to be when in fee-ding he ac-ci-den-tal-ly ta-kes in wa-ter But the Sperm Wha-les food is far be-neath the sur-fa-ce and the-re he can-not spout e-ven if he would Be-si-des if yo-u re-gard him ve-ry clo-se-ly and ti-me him with yo-ur watch yo-u will find that when un-mo-les-ted the-re is an un-de-via-ting rhy-me be-tween the pe-riods of his jets and the or-di-na-ry pe-riods of res-pi-ra-tion But why pes-ter o-ne with all this rea-so-ning on the sub-ject Speak out Yo-u ha-ve seen him spout then de-cla-re what the spout is can yo-u not tell wa-ter from air My dear sir in this world it is not so ea-sy to set-tle the-se plain things  ha-ve e-ver found yo-ur plain things the knot-tiest of all  as for this wha-le spout yo-u might al-most stand in it and yet be un-de-ci-ded as to what it is pre-ci-se-ly The cen-tral bo-dy of it is hid-den in the sno-wy spar-kling mist en-ve-lo-ping it and how can yo-u cer-tain-ly tell whet-her a-ny wa-ter falls from it when al-ways when yo-u a-re clo-se e-nough to a wha-le to get a clo-se view of his spout he is in a pro-di-gio-us

man or fish wrig-gling is a sign of in-fe-rio-ri-ty To the wha-le his tail is the so-le means of pro-pul-sion Scroll-wi-se coi-led for-wards be-neath the bo-dy and then ra-pi-dly sprung bac-kwards it is this which gi-ves that sin-gu-lar dar-ting lea-ping mo-tion to the mons-ter when fu-rio-u-sly swim-ming His si-de-fins on-ly ser-ve to steer by Se-cond  is a lit-tle si-gni-fi-cant that whi-le o-ne

cur-ves a-way his flu-kes from it and the blow is on-ly in-flic-ted by the re-coil  it be ma-de in the u-nobs-truc-ted air es-pe-cial-ly if it des-cend to its mark the stro-ke is then sim-ply ir-re-sis-ti-ble No ribs of man or boat can withs-tand it Yo-ur on-ly sal-va-tion lies in e-lu-ding it but if it co-mes si-de-ways through the op-po-sing wa-ter then par-tly o-wing to the light buo-y-an-cy of the wha-le boat and the e-las-ti-ci-ty of its ma-te-rials a crac-ked rib or a das-hed plank or two a sort of stitch in the si-de is ge-ne-ral-ly the most se-rio-us re-sult The-se

but it seems to me that in the wha-le the sen-se of touch is con-cen-tra-ted in the tail for in this res-pect the-re is a de-li-ca-cy in it on-ly e-qual-led by the dain-ti-ness of the e-lep-hants trunk This de-li-ca-cy is chie-fly e-vin-ced in the ac-tion of swee-ping when in mai-den-ly gen-tle-ness the wha-le with a cer-tain soft slow-ness mo-ves his im-men-se flu-kes from si-de to si-de u-pon the sur-fa-ce of the sea and if he feel but a sai-lors whis-ker woe to that sai-lor whis-kers and all What ten-der-ness the-re is in that pre-li-mi-na-ry touch Had this tail a-ny pre-hen-si-le po-wer  should straigh-tway bet-hink me of Dar-mo-no-des e-lep-hant that so fre-quen-ted the flo-wer-mar-ket and with low sa-lu-ta-tions pre-sen-ted no-se-gays to dam-sels and then ca-res-sed their zo-nes  mo-re ac-counts than o-ne a pi-ty it is that the wha-le does not pos-sess this pre-hen-si-le vir-tue in his tail for  ha-ve heard of yet a-not-her e-lep-hant that when woun-ded in the fight cur-ved round his trunk and ex-trac-ted the dart Fourth Stea-ling u-na-wa-res u-pon the wha-le in the fan-cied se-cu-ri-ty of the mid-dle of so-li-ta-ry seas yo-u find him un-bent from the vast cor-pu-len-ce of his di-gni-ty and kit-ten-li-ke he plays on the o-cean as if it we-re a hearth But still yo-u see his po-wer in his play The broad palms of his tail a-re flir-ted high in-to the air then smi-ting the sur-fa-ce the thun-de-rous con-cus-sion re-sounds for mi-les Yo-u would al-most think a great gun had been disc-har-ged and if yo-u no-ti-ced the light wreath of va-pour from the spi-ra-cle at his ot-her ex-tre-mi-ty yo-u would think that that was the smo-ke from the touch-ho-le Fifth  in the or-di-na-ry floa-ting pos-tu-re of the le-viat-han the flu-kes lie con-si-de-ra-bly be-low the le-vel of his back they a-re then com-ple-te-ly out of sight be-neath the sur-fa-ce but when he is a-bout to plun-ge in-to the deeps his en-ti-re flu-kes with at least thir-ty feet of his bo-dy a-re tos-sed e-rect in the air and so re-main vi-bra-ting a mo-ment till they down-wards shoot out of view Excep-ting the su-bli-me breac-hso-mew-he-re el-se to be des-cri-bedt-his pea-king of the wha-les flu-kes is per-haps the gran-dest sight to be seen in all a-ni-ma-ted na-tu-re Out of the bot-tom-less pro-fun-di-ties the gi-gan-tic tail seems spa-smo-di-cal-ly snatc-hing at the hig-hest hea-ven So in dreams ha-ve  seen ma-jes-tic Sa-tan thrus-ting forth his tor-men-ted co-los-sal claw from the fla-me Bal-tic of Hell But in ga-zing at such sce-nes it is all in all what mood

tend to pla-ce tho-se two op-po-si-te or-gans on an e-qua-li-ty much less the crea-tu-res to which they res-pec-ti-ve-ly be-long For as the migh-tiest e-lep-hant is but a ter-rier to Le-viat-han so com-pa-red with Le-viat-hans tail his trunk is but the stalk of a li-ly The most di-re-ful blow from the e-lep-hants trunk we-re as the play-ful tap of a fan com-pa-red with the mea-su-re-less crush

two af-ter the last wha-ling sce-ne re-coun-ted and when we we-re slow-ly sai-ling o-ver a slee-py va-pou-ry mid-day sea that the ma-ny no-ses on the Pe-quods deck pro-ved mo-re vi-gi-lant dis-co-ve-rers than the three pairs of ey-es a-loft  pe-cu-liar and not ve-ry plea-sant smell was smelt in the sea  will bet so-met-hing now said Stubb that so-mew-he-re he-rea-bouts a-re so-me of tho-se drug-ged wha-les we tic-kled the ot-her day  thought they would keel up be-fo-re long Pre-sen-tly the va-pours in a-dvan-ce slid a-si-de and the-re in the dis-tan-ce lay a ship who-se fur-led sails be-to-ke-ned that so-me sort of wha-le must be a-lon-gsi-de  we gli-ded nea-rer the stran-ger sho-wed French co-lours from his peak and by the ed-dying cloud of vul-tu-re sea-fowl that cir-cled and ho-ve-red and swoo-ped a-round him it was plain that the wha-le a-lon-gsi-de must be what the fis-her-men call a blas-ted wha-le that is a wha-le that has died un-mo-les-ted on the sea and so floa-ted an u-nap-pro-pria-ted cor-pse  may well be con-cei-ved what an un-sa-vo-ry o-dor such a mass must ex-ha-le wor-se than an Assy-rian ci-ty in the pla-gue when the li-ving a-re in-com-pe-tent to bu-ry the de-par-ted So in-to-le-ra-ble in-deed is it re-gar-ded by so-me that no cu-pi-di-ty could per-sua-de them to moor a-lon-gsi-de of it Yet a-re the-re tho-se who will still do it no-twiths-tan-ding the fact that the oil ob-tai-ned from such sub-jects is of a ve-ry in-fe-rior qua-li-ty and by no means of the na-tu-re of at-ta-ro-fro-se Co-ming still nea-rer with the ex-pi-ring bree-ze we saw that the Frenc-hman had a se-cond wha-le a-lon-gsi-de and this se-cond wha-le see-med e-ven mo-re of a no-se-gay than the first  truth it tur-ned out to be o-ne of tho-se pro-ble-ma-ti-cal wha-les that seem to dry up and die with a sort of pro-di-gio-us dys-pe-psia or in-di-ges-tion lea-ving their de-funct bo-dies al-most en-ti-re-ly ban-krupt of a-nyt-hing li-ke oil Ne-vert-he-less in the pro-per pla-ce we shall see that no kno-wing fis-her-man will e-ver turn up his no-se at such a wha-le as this ho-we-ver much he may shun blas-ted wha-les in ge-ne-ral The Pe-quod had now swept so nigh to the stran-ger that Stubb vo-wed he re-co-gni-sed his cut-ting spa-de-po-le en-tan-gled in the li-nes that we-re knot-ted round the tail of o-ne of the-se wha-les The-res a pret-ty fel-low now he ban-te-rin-gly laug-hed stan-ding in the ships bows the-res a jac-kal for ye  well know that the-se Crap-poes of Frenc-hmen a-re but poor de-vils in the fis-he-ry so-me-ti-mes lo-we-ring their boats for brea-kers mis-ta-king them for Sperm Wha-le spouts yes and so-me-ti-mes sai-ling from their port with their hold full of bo-xes of tal-low can-dles and ca-ses of snuf-fers fo-re-see-ing that all the oil they will get wont be e-nough to dip the Cap-tains wick in-to ay-e we all know the-se things but look ye he-res a Crap-po that is con-tent with our lea-vings the drug-ged wha-le the-re  mean ay-e and is con-tent too with scra-ping the dry bo-nes of that ot-her pre-cio-us fish he has the-re Poor de-vil  say pass round a hat so-me o-ne and lets ma-ke him a pre-sent of a lit-tle oil for dear cha-ri-tys sa-ke For what oil hell get from that drug-ged wha-le the-re wouldnt be fit to burn in a jail no not in a con-dem-ned cell  as for the ot-her wha-le why  a-gree to get mo-re oil by chop-ping up and trying out the-se three masts of ours than hell get from that bun-dle of bo-nes though now that  think of it it may con-tain so-met-hing worth a good deal mo-re than oil yes am-ber-gris  won-der now if our old man has thought of that  worth trying Yes  for it and so say-ing he star-ted for the quar-ter-deck By this ti-me the faint air had be-co-me a com-ple-te calm so that whet-her or no the Pe-quod was now fair-ly en-trap-ped in the smell with no ho-pe of es-ca-ping ex-cept by its bree-zing up a-gain Issuing from the ca-bin Stubb now cal-led his boats crew and pul-led off for the stran-ger Dra-wing a-cross her bow he per-cei-ved that in ac-cor-dan-ce with the fan-ci-ful French tas-te the up-per part of her stem-pie-ce was car-ved in the li-ke-ness of a hu-ge droo-ping stalk was pain-ted green and for thorns had cop-per spi-kes pro-jec-ting from it he-re and the-re the who-le ter-mi-na-ting in a sym-me-tri-cal fol-ded bulb of a bright red co-lour Upon her head boards in lar-ge gilt let-ters he read Bou-ton de Ro-se-Ro-se-but-ton or Ro-se-bud and this was the ro-man-tic na-me of this a-ro-ma-tic ship Though Stubb did not un-ders-tand the Bou-ton part of the ins-crip-tion yet the word ro-se and the bul-bous fi-gu-re-head put to-get-her suf-fi-cien-tly ex-plai-ned the who-le to him  woo-den ro-se-bud eh he cried with his hand to his no-se that will do ve-ry well but how li-ke all crea-tion it smells Now in or-der to hold di-rect com-mu-ni-ca-tion with the peo-ple on deck he had to pull round the bows to the star-board si-de and thus co-me clo-se to the blas-ted wha-le and so talk o-ver it Arri-ved then at this spot with o-ne hand still to his no-se he baw-led-Bou-ton-de-Ro-se a-hoy a-re the-re a-ny of yo-u Bou-ton-de-Ro-ses that speak English Yes re-joi-ned a Guern-sey-man from the bul-warks who tur-ned out to be the chie-fma-te Well then my Bou-ton-de-Ro-se-bud ha-ve yo-u seen the Whi-te Wha-le What wha-le The Whi-te Wha-lea Sperm Wha-le-Mo-by Dick ha-ve ye seen him Ne-ver heard of such a wha-le Cac-ha-lot Blanc-he Whi-te Wha-le-no Ve-ry good then good bye now and  call a-gain in a mi-nu-te Then ra-pi-dly pul-ling back to-wards the Pe-quod and see-ing Ahab lea-ning o-ver the quar-ter-deck rail a-wai-ting his re-port he moul-ded his two hands in-to a trum-pet and shou-te-dNo Sir No Upon which Ahab re-ti-red and Stubb re-tur-ned to the Frenc-hman He now per-cei-ved that the Guern-sey-man who had just got in-to the chains and was u-sing a cut-tings-pa-de had slung his no-se in a sort of bag Whats the mat-ter with yo-ur no-se the-re said Stubb Bro-ke it  wish it was bro-ken or that  didnt ha-ve a-ny no-se at all an-swe-red the Guern-sey-man who did not seem to re-lish the job he was at ve-ry much But what a-re yo-u hol-ding yo-urs for  not-hing  a wax no-se  ha-ve to hold it on Fi-ne day aint it Air rat-her gar-den-ny  should say throw us a bunch of po-sies will ye Bou-ton-de-Ro-se What in the de-vils na-me do yo-u want he-re roa-red the Guern-sey-man flying in-to a sud-den pas-sion  keep coolcool yes thats the word why dont yo-u pack tho-se wha-les in i-ce whi-le yo-u-re wor-king at em But jo-king a-si-de though do yo-u know Ro-se-bud that its all non-sen-se trying to get a-ny oil out of such wha-les  for that dried up o-ne the-re he hasnt a gill in his who-le car-ca-se  know that well e-nough but dye see the Cap-tain he-re wont be-lie-ve it this is his first voy-a-ge he was a Co-lo-gne ma-nu-fac-tu-rer be-fo-re But co-me a-board and may-hap hell be-lie-ve yo-u if he wont me and so  get out of this dir-ty scra-pe Anyt-hing to o-bli-ge ye my sweet and plea-sant fel-low re-joi-ned Stubb and with that he soon moun-ted to the deck The-re a que-er sce-ne pre-sen-ted i-tself The sai-lors in tas-sel-led caps of red wors-ted we-re get-ting the hea-vy tac-kles in rea-di-ness for the wha-les But they wor-ked rat-her slow and tal-ked ve-ry fast and see-med in a-nyt-hing but a good hu-mor  their no-ses u-pwar-dly pro-jec-ted from their fa-ces li-ke so ma-ny jib-booms Now and then pairs of them would drop their work and run up to the mast-head to get so-me fresh air So-me thin-king they would catch the pla-gue dip-ped oa-kum in coal-tar and at in-ter-vals held it to their nos-trils Others ha-ving bro-ken the stems of their pi-pes al-most short off at the bowl we-re vi-go-rou-sly puf-fing to-bac-co-smo-ke so that it cons-tan-tly fil-led their ol-fac-to-ries Stubb was struck by a sho-wer of out-cries and a-nat-he-mas pro-cee-ding from the Cap-tains round-hou-se a-baft and loo-king in that di-rec-tion saw a fie-ry fa-ce thrust from be-hind the door which was held a-jar from wit-hin This was the tor-men-ted sur-geon who af-ter in vain re-mons-tra-ting a-gainst the pro-cee-dings of the day had be-ta-ken him-self to the Cap-tains round-hou-se ca-bi-net he cal-led it to a-void the pest but still could not help yel-ling out his en-trea-ties and in-di-gna-tions at ti-mes Mar-king all this Stubb ar-gued well for his sche-me and tur-ning to the Guern-sey-man had a lit-tle chat with him du-ring which the stran-ger ma-te ex-pres-sed his de-tes-ta-tion of his Cap-tain as a con-cei-ted i-gno-ra-mus who had brought them all in-to so un-sa-vo-ry and un-pro-fi-ta-ble a pic-kle Soun-ding him ca-re-ful-ly Stubb furt-her per-cei-ved that the Guern-sey-man had not the sligh-test sus-pi-cion con-cer-ning the am-ber-gris He the-refo-re held his pea-ce on that head but ot-her-wi-se was qui-te frank and con-fi-den-tial with him so that the two quic-kly con-coc-ted a lit-tle plan for both cir-cum-ven-ting and sa-ti-ri-zing the Cap-tain wit-hout his at all drea-ming of dis-trus-ting their sin-ce-ri-ty Accor-ding to this lit-tle plan of theirs the Guern-sey-man un-der co-ver of an in-ter-pre-ters of-fi-ce was to tell the Cap-tain what he plea-sed but as co-ming from Stubb and as for Stubb he was to ut-ter a-ny non-sen-se that should co-me up-per-most in him du-ring the in-ter-view By this ti-me their des-ti-ned vic-tim ap-pea-red from his ca-bin He was a small and dark but rat-her de-li-ca-te loo-king man for a sea-cap-tain with lar-ge whis-kers and mous-tac-he ho-we-ver and wo-re a red cot-ton vel-vet vest with watc-hseals at his si-de To this gen-tle-man Stubb was now po-li-te-ly in-tro-du-ced by the Guern-sey-man who at on-ce os-ten-ta-tio-u-sly put on the as-pect of in-ter-pre-ting be-tween them What shall  say to him first said he Why said Stubb ey-e-ing the vel-vet vest and the watch and seals yo-u may as well be-gin by tel-ling him that he looks a sort of ba-byish to me though  dont pre-tend to be a jud-ge He says Mon-sie-ur said the Guern-sey-man in French tur-ning to his cap-tain that on-ly yes-ter-day his ship spo-ke a ves-sel who-se cap-tain and chie-fma-te with six sai-lors had all died of a fe-ver caught from a blas-ted wha-le they had brought a-lon-gsi-de Upon this the cap-tain star-ted and ea-ger-ly de-si-red to know mo-re What now said the Guern-sey-man to Stubb Why sin-ce he ta-kes it so ea-sy tell him that now  ha-ve ey-ed him ca-re-ful-ly  qui-te cer-tain that hes no mo-re fit to com-mand a wha-les-hip than a  Ja-go mon-key  fact tell him from me hes a ba-boon He vows and de-cla-res Mon-sie-ur that the ot-her wha-le the dried o-ne is far mo-re dea-dly than the blas-ted o-ne in fi-ne Mon-sie-ur he con-ju-res us as we va-lue our li-ves to cut loo-se from the-se fish Instan-tly the cap-tain ran for-ward and in a loud voi-ce com-man-ded his crew to de-sist from hois-ting the cut-ting-tac-kles and at on-ce cast loo-se the ca-bles and chains con-fi-ning the wha-les to the ship What now said the Guern-sey-man when the Cap-tain had re-tur-ned to them Why let me see yes yo-u may as well tell him now thatt-ha-tin fact tell him Ive did-dled him and a-si-de to him-self per-haps so-me-bo-dy el-se He says Mon-sie-ur that hes ve-ry hap-py to ha-ve been of a-ny ser-vi-ce to us Hea-ring this the cap-tain vo-wed that they we-re the gra-te-ful par-ties mea-ning him-self and ma-te and con-clu-ded by in-vi-ting Stubb down in-to his ca-bin to drink a bot-tle of Bor-dea-ux He wants yo-u to ta-ke a glass of wi-ne with him said the in-terpre-ter Thank him hear-ti-ly but tell him its a-gainst my prin-ci-ples to drink with the man Ive did-dled  fact tell him  must go He says Mon-sie-ur that his prin-ci-ples wont a-dmit of his drin-king but that if Mon-sie-ur wants to li-ve a-not-her day to drink then Mon-sie-ur had best drop all four boats and pull the ship a-way from the-se wha-les for its so calm they wont drift By this ti-me Stubb was o-ver the si-de and get-ting in-to his boat hai-led the Guern-sey-man to this ef-fectt-hat ha-ving a long tow-li-ne in his boat he would do what he could to help them by pul-ling out the ligh-ter wha-le of the two from the ships si-de Whi-le the Frenc-hmans boats then we-re en-ga-ged in to-wing the ship o-ne way Stubb be-ne-vo-len-tly to-wed a-way at his wha-le the ot-her way os-ten-ta-tio-u-sly slac-king out a most u-nu-sual-ly long tow-li-ne Pre-sen-tly a bree-ze sprang up Stubb fei-gned to cast off from the wha-le hois-ting his boats the Frenc-hman soon in-crea-sed his dis-tan-ce whi-le the Pe-quod slid in be-tween him and Stubbs wha-le Whe-reu-pon Stubb quic-kly pul-led to the floa-ting bo-dy and hai-ling the Pe-quod to gi-ve no-ti-ce of his in-ten-tions at on-ce pro-cee-ded to reap the fruit of his un-righ-teo-us cun-ning Sei-zing his sharp boats-pa-de he com-men-ced an ex-ca-va-tion in the bo-dy a lit-tle be-hind the si-de fin Yo-u would al-most ha-ve thought he was dig-ging a cel-lar the-re in the sea and when at length his spa-de struck a-gainst the gaunt ribs it was li-ke tur-ning up old Ro-man ti-les and pot-te-ry bu-ried in fat English loam His boats crew we-re all in high ex-ci-te-ment ea-ger-ly hel-ping their chief and loo-king as an-xio-us as gold-hun-ters  all the ti-me num-ber-less fowls we-re di-ving and duc-king and screa-ming and yel-ling and figh-ting a-round them Stubb was be-gin-ning to look di-sap-poin-ted es-pe-cial-ly as the hor-ri-ble no-se-gay in-crea-sed when sud-den-ly from out the ve-ry heart of this pla-gue the-re sto-le a faint stream of per-fu-me which flo-wed through the ti-de of bad smells wit-hout being a-bsor-bed by it as o-ne ri-ver will flow in-to and then a-long with a-not-her wit-hout at all blen-ding with it for a ti-me  ha-ve it  ha-ve it cried Stubb with de-light stri-king so-met-hing in the sub-ter-ra-nean re-gions a pur-se a pur-se Drop-ping his spa-de he thrust both hands in and drew out han-dfuls of so-met-hing that loo-ked li-ke ri-pe Win-dsor soap or rich mot-tled old chee-se ve-ry unc-tuo-us and sa-vo-ry wit-hal Yo-u might ea-si-ly dent it with yo-ur thumb it is of a hue be-tween yel-low and ash co-lour  this good friends is am-ber-gris worth a gold gui-nea an oun-ce to a-ny drug-gist So-me six han-dfuls we-re ob-tai-ned but mo-re was u-na-voi-da-bly lost in the sea and still mo-re per-haps might ha-ve been se-cu-red we-re it not for im-pa-tient Ahabs loud com-mand to Stubb to de-sist and co-me on board el-se the ship would bid them good bye Now this am-ber-gris is a ve-ry cu-rio-us subs-tan-ce and so im-por-tant as an ar-ti-cle of com-mer-ce that in a cer-tain Nan-tuc-ket-born Cap-tain Cof-fin was e-xa-mi-ned at the bar of the English Hou-se of Com-mons on that sub-ject For at that ti-me and in-deed un-til a com-pa-ra-ti-ve-ly la-te day the pre-ci-se o-ri-gin of am-ber-gris re-mai-ned li-ke am-ber i-tself a pro-blem to the lear-ned Though the word am-ber-gris is but the French com-pound for grey am-ber yet the two subs-tan-ces a-re qui-te dis-tinct For am-ber though at ti-mes found on the sea-coast is al-so dug up in so-me far in-land soils whe-reas am-ber-gris is ne-ver found ex-cept u-pon the sea Be-si-des am-ber is a hard trans-pa-rent brit-tle o-dor-less subs-tan-ce u-sed for mouth-pie-ces to pi-pes for beads and or-na-ments but am-ber-gris is soft wa-xy and so hig-hly fra-grant and spi-cy that it is lar-ge-ly u-sed in per-fu-me-ry in pas-ti-les pre-cio-us can-dles hair-pow-ders and po-ma-tum The Turks u-se it in coo-king and al-so car-ry it to Mec-ca for the sa-me pur-po-se that fran-kin-cen-se is car-ried to  Pe-ters in Ro-me So-me wi-ne merc-hants drop a few grains in-to cla-ret to fla-vor it Who would think then that such fi-ne la-dies and gen-tle-men should re-ga-le them-sel-ves with an es-sen-ce found in the in-glo-rio-us bo-wels of a sick wha-le Yet so it is By so-me am-ber-gris is sup-po-sed to be the cau-se and by ot-hers the ef-fect of the dys-pe-psia in the wha-le How to cu-re such a dys-pe-psia it we-re hard to say un-less by a-dmi-nis-te-ring three or four boat loads of Bran-dreths pills and then run-ning out of harms way as la-bo-rers do in blas-ting rocks  ha-ve for-got-ten to say that the-re we-re found in this am-ber-gris cer-tain hard round bo-ny pla-tes which at first Stubb thought might be sai-lors trow-sers but-tons but it af-ter-wards tur-ned out that they we-re not-hing mo-re than pie-ces of small squid bo-nes em-bal-med in that man-ner Now that the in-cor-rup-tion of this most fra-grant am-ber-gris should be found in the heart of such de-cay is this not-hing Bet-hink thee of that say-ing of  Paul in Co-rint-hians a-bout cor-rup-tion and in-cor-rup-tion how that we a-re sown in dis-ho-nour but rai-sed in glo-ry  li-ke-wi-se call to mind that say-ing of Pa-ra-cel-sus a-bout what it is that ma-keth the best musk Also for-get not the stran-ge fact that of all things of ill-sa-vor Co-lo-gne-wa-ter in its ru-di-men-tal ma-nu-fac-tu-ring sta-ges is the worst  should li-ke to con-clu-de the chap-ter with the a-bo-ve ap-peal but can-not o-wing to my an-xie-ty to re-pel a char-ge of-ten ma-de a-gainst wha-le-men and which in the es-ti-ma-tion of so-me al-rea-dy bia-sed minds might be con-si-de-red as in-di-rec-tly subs-tan-tia-ted by what has been said of the Frenc-hmans two wha-les Elsew-he-re in this vo-lu-me the slan-de-rous as-per-sion has been dis-pro-ved that the vo-ca-tion of wha-ling is throug-hout a slat-tern-ly un-ti-dy bu-si-ness But the-re is a-not-her thing to re-but They hint that all wha-les al-ways smell bad Now how did this o-dio-us sti-gma o-ri-gi-na-te  o-pi-ne that it is plain-ly tra-cea-ble to the first ar-ri-val of the Green-land wha-ling ships in Lon-don mo-re than two cen-tu-ries a-go Be-cau-se tho-se wha-le-men did not then and do not now try out their oil at sea as the Sout-hern ships ha-ve al-ways do-ne but cut-ting up the fresh blub-ber in small bits thrust it through the bung ho-les of lar-ge casks and car-ry it ho-me in that man-ner the shor-tness of the sea-son in tho-se Icy Seas and the sud-den and vio-lent storms to which they a-re ex-po-sed for-bid-ding a-ny ot-her cour-se The con-se-quen-ce is that u-pon brea-king in-to the hold and un-loa-ding o-ne of the-se wha-le ce-me-te-ries in the Green-land dock a sa-vor is gi-ven forth so-mew-hat si-mi-lar to

im-pu-ted to the e-xis-ten-ce on the coast of Green-land in for-mer ti-mes of a Dutch vil-la-ge cal-led Schme-ren-burgh or Smee-ren-berg which lat-ter na-me is the o-ne u-sed by the lear-ned Fo-go Von

cer-tain-ly ga-ve forth no ve-ry plea-sant sa-vor But all this is qui-te dif-fe-rent with a South Sea Sperm Wha-ler which in a voy-a-ge of four ye-ars per-haps af-ter com-ple-te-ly fil-ling her hold with oil does not per-haps con-su-me fif-ty days in the bu-si-ness of boi-ling out and in the sta-te that it is cas-ked the oil is near-ly scen-tless The truth is that li-ving or dead if but de-cen-tly trea-ted wha-les as a spe-cies a-re by no means crea-tu-res of ill o-dor nor can wha-le-men be re-co-gni-sed as the peo-ple of the mid-dle a-ges af-fec-ted to de-tect a Jew in the com-pa-ny by the no-se Nor in-deed can the wha-le pos-si-bly be ot-her-wi-se than fra-grant when as a ge-ne-ral thing he en-joys such high health ta-king a-bun-dan-ce of e-xer-ci-se al-ways out of doors though it is true sel-dom in the o-pen air  say that the mo-tion of a Sperm Wha-les flu-kes a-bo-ve wa-ter dis-pen-ses a per-fu-me as when a musks-cen-ted la-dy rus-tles her dress in a warm par-lor What then

ten-der-hear-ted was at bot-tom ve-ry bright with that plea-sant ge-nial jol-ly brigh-tness pe-cu-liar to his tri-be a tri-be which e-ver en-joy all ho-li-days and fes-ti-vi-ties with fi-ner freer

lit-tle black was bril-liant for e-ven blac-kness has its bril-lian-cy be-hold yon lus-trous e-bo-ny pa-nel-led in kings ca-bi-nets But Pip lo-ved li-fe and all li-fes pea-cea-ble se-cu-ri-ties so that the pa-nics-tri-king bu-si-ness in which he had so-me-how u-nac-coun-ta-bly be-co-me en-trap-ped had most sa-dly blur-red his brigh-tness though as e-re long will be seen what was thus tem-po-ra-ri-ly sub-dued in him in the end was des-ti-ned to be lu-ri-dly il-lu-mi-ned by stran-ge wild fi-res that fic-ti-tio-u-sly sho-wed him off to ten ti-mes the na-tu-ral lus-tre with which in

The first ti-me Stubb lo-we-red with him Pip e-vin-ced much ner-vou-sness but hap-pi-ly for that ti-me es-ca-ped clo-se con-tact with the wha-le and the-refo-re ca-me off not al-to-get-her

o-ver-board with him so as to be-co-me en-tan-gled in it when at last plum-ping in-to the wa-ter That ins-tant the stric-ken wha-le star-ted on a fier-ce run the li-ne swif-tly straigh-te-ned and

He was full of the fi-re of the hunt He ha-ted Pip for a pol-troon Snatc-hing the boat-kni-fe from its sheath he sus-pen-ded its sharp ed-ge o-ver the li-ne and tur-ning to-wards Stubb ex-clai-med

and so the wha-le was lost and Pip was sa-ved So soon as he re-co-ve-red him-self the poor lit-tle ne-gro was as-sai-led by yells and e-xe-cra-tions from the crew Tran-quil-ly per-mit-ting the-se ir-re-gu-lar cur-sings to e-va-po-ra-te Stubb then in a plain bu-si-nes-sli-ke but still half hu-mo-rous man-ner cur-sed Pip of-fi-cial-ly and that do-ne u-nof-fi-cial-ly ga-ve him much who-le-so-me

would be lea-ving him too wi-de a mar-gin to jump in for the fu-tu-re Stubb sud-den-ly drop-ped all a-dvi-ce and con-clu-ded with a pe-remp-to-ry com-mand Stick to the boat Pip or by the Lord  wont

wha-le star-ted to run Pip was left be-hind on the sea li-ke a hur-ried tra-vel-lers trunk Alas Stubb was but too true to his word  was a bea-u-ti-ful boun-teo-us blue day the span-gled sea calm and

was be-tween Pip and Stubb Out from the cen-tre of the sea poor Pip tur-ned his crisp cur-ling black head to the sun a-not-her lo-ne-ly cas-ta-way though the lof-tiest and the brigh-test Now in calm weat-her to swim in the o-pen o-cean is as ea-sy to the prac-ti-sed swim-mer as to ri-de in a spring-car-ria-ge as-ho-re But the aw-ful lo-ne-so-me-ness is in-to-le-ra-ble The in-ten-se

and on-ly coast a-long her si-des But had Stubb real-ly a-ban-do-ned the poor lit-tle ne-gro to his fa-te No he did not mean to at least Be-cau-se the-re we-re two boats in his wa-ke and he sup-po-sed no doubt that they would of cour-se co-me up to Pip ve-ry quic-kly and pick him up though in-deed such con-si-de-ra-tions to-wards oar-smen jeo-par-di-zed through their own ti-mi-di-ty is not al-ways

ga-ve cha-se and Stubbs boat was now so far a-way and he and all his crew so in-tent u-pon his fish that Pips rin-ged ho-ri-zon be-gan to ex-pand a-round him mi-se-ra-bly By the me-rest chan-ce the ship i-tself at last res-cued him but from that hour the lit-tle ne-gro went a-bout the deck an i-diot such at least they said he was The sea had jee-rin-gly kept his fi-ni-te bo-dy up but drow-ned the in-fi-ni-te of his soul Not drow-ned en-ti-re-ly though Rat-her car-ried down a-li-ve to won-drous depths whe-re stran-ge sha-pes of the un-war-ped pri-mal world gli-ded to and fro be-fo-re his

un-com-pro-mi-sed in-dif-fe-rent as his God For the rest bla-me not Stubb too har-dly The thing is com-mon in that fis-he-ry and in the se-quel of the nar-ra-ti-ve it will then be seen what li-ke a-ban-don-ment be-fell my-self That wha-le of Stubbs so dear-ly purc-ha-sed was du-ly brought to the Pe-quods si-de whe-re all tho-se cut-ting and hois-ting o-pe-ra-tions pre-vio-u-sly de-tai-led

with such e-ner-gy u-pon a thwart of his boat that his i-vo-ry leg had re-cei-ved a halfs-plin-te-ring shock  when af-ter gai-ning his own deck and his own pi-vot-ho-le the-re he so ve-he-men-tly whee-led round with an ur-gent com-mand to the steer-sman it was as e-ver so-met-hing a-bout his not stee-ring in-fle-xi-bly e-nough then the al-rea-dy sha-ken i-vo-ry re-cei-ved such an ad-di-tio-nal twist and wrench that though it still re-mai-ned en-ti-re and to all ap-pea-ran-ces lus-ty yet Ahab did not deem it en-ti-re-ly trus-twort-hy  in-deed it see-med small mat-ter for won-der that for all his per-va-ding mad rec-kles-sness Ahab did at ti-mes gi-ve ca-re-ful heed to the con-di-tion of that dead bo-ne u-pon which he par-tly stood For it had not been ve-ry long prior to the Pe-quods sai-ling from Nan-tuc-ket that he had been found o-ne night lying pro-ne u-pon the ground and in-sen-si-ble by so-me un-known and see-min-gly i-nex-pli-ca-ble u-ni-ma-gi-na-ble ca-sual-ty his i-vo-ry

cu-red Nor at the ti-me had it fai-led to en-ter his mo-no-ma-niac mind that all the an-guish of that then pre-sent suf-fe-ring was but the di-rect is-sue of a for-mer woe and he too plain-ly see-med to see that as the most poi-so-nous rep-ti-le of the marsh per-pe-tua-tes his kind as i-ne-vi-ta-bly as the swee-test songs-ter of the gro-ve so e-qual-ly with e-ve-ry fe-li-ci-ty all mi-se-ra-ble e-vents do na-tu-ral-ly be-get their li-ke Ye-a mo-re than e-qual-ly thought Ahab sin-ce both the an-ces-try and pos-te-ri-ty of Grief go furt-her than the an-ces-try and pos-te-ri-ty of Joy For not to hint of this that it is an in-fe-ren-ce from cer-tain ca-no-nic teac-hings that whi-le so-me na-tu-ral en-joy-ments he-re shall ha-ve no chil-dren born to them for the ot-her world but on the

pro-ge-ny of griefs bey-ond the gra-ve not at all to hint of this the-re still seems an i-ne-qua-li-ty in the dee-per a-na-ly-sis of the thing For thought Ahab whi-le e-ven the hig-hest eart-hly fe-li-ci-ties e-ver ha-ve a cer-tain un-si-gni-fying pet-ti-ness lur-king in them but at bot-tom all hear-twoes a mys-tic si-gni-fi-can-ce and in so-me men an arc-han-ge-lic gran-deur so do their di-li-gent tra-cin-gsout not be-lie the o-bvio-us de-duc-tion To trail the ge-nea-lo-gies of the-se high mor-tal mi-se-ries car-ries us at last a-mong the sour-ce-less pri-mo-ge-ni-tu-res of the gods so that in the fa-ce of all the glad hay-ma-king suns and soft cym-bal-ling round har-ves-tmoons we must needs gi-ve in to this that the gods them-sel-ves a-re not for e-ver glad The i-nef-fa-cea-ble sad birt-hmark in the brow of man is but the stamp of sor-row in the si-gners Unwit-tin-gly he-re a se-cret has been di-vul-ged which per-haps might mo-re pro-per-ly in set way ha-ve been dis-clo-sed be-fo-re With ma-ny ot-her par-ti-cu-lars con-cer-ning Ahab al-ways had it re-mai-ned a mys-te-ry to so-me why it was that for a cer-tain pe-riod both be-fo-re and af-ter the sai-ling of the Pe-quod he had hid-den him-self a-way with such Gran-dLa-ma-li-ke ex-clu-si-ve-ness and for that o-ne in-ter-val sought speec-hless re-fu-ge as it we-re a-mong the mar-ble se-na-te of the dead Cap-tain Pe-legs brui-ted rea-son for this thing ap-pea-red by no means a-de-qua-te though in-deed as touc-hing all Ahabs dee-per part e-ve-ry re-ve-la-tion par-took mo-re of si-gni-fi-cant dar-kness than of ex-pla-na-to-ry light But in the end it all ca-me out this o-ne mat-ter did at least That di-re-ful mis-hap was at the bot-tom of his tem-po-ra-ry re-clu-se-ness  not on-ly this but to that e-ver-con-trac-ting drop-ping cir-cle as-ho-re who for a-ny rea-son pos-ses-sed the pri-vi-le-ge of a less ban-ned ap-proach to him to that ti-mid cir-cle the a-bo-ve hin-ted ca-sual-ty-re-mai-ning as

pre-sent mat-ter of his leg he took plain prac-ti-cal pro-ce-du-res-he cal-led the car-pen-ter  when that func-tio-na-ry ap-pea-red be-fo-re him he ba-de him wit-hout de-lay set a-bout ma-king a new

down in-to the ca-bin to re-port this un-fa-vou-ra-ble af-fair  Spermw-ha-le-men with a-ny con-si-de-ra-ble quan-ti-ty of oil on board it is a re-gu-lar se-mi-wee-kly du-ty to con-duct a ho-se in-to the hold and drench the casks with sea-wa-ter which af-ter-wards at va-rying in-ter-vals is re-mo-ved by the ships pumps He-re-by the casks a-re sought to be kept dam-ply tight whi-le by the chan-ged cha-rac-ter of the with-drawn wa-ter the ma-ri-ners rea-di-ly de-tect a-ny se-rio-us lea-ka-ge in the pre-cio-us car-go Now from the South and West the Pe-quod was dra-wing nigh to For-mo-sa and the Bas-hee Isles be-tween which lies o-ne of the tro-pi-cal ou-tlets from the Chi-na wa-ters in-to the Pa-ci-fic  so Star-buck found Ahab with a ge-ne-ral chart of the o-rien-tal arc-hi-pe-la-goes spread be-fo-re him and a-not-her se-pa-ra-te o-ne re-pre-sen-ting the long eas-tern coasts of the Ja-pa-ne-se i-slan-dsNip-hon Ma-tsmai and Si-ko-ke With his snoww-hi-te new i-vo-ry leg bra-ced a-gainst the scre-wed leg of his ta-ble and with a long pru-ning-hook of a jack-kni-fe in his hand the won-drous old man with his back to the gan-gway door was wrin-kling his brow and tra-cing his old cour-ses a-gain Whos the-re hea-ring the foots-tep at the door but not tur-ning round to it  deck Be-go-ne Cap-tain Ahab mis-ta-kes it is  The oil in the hold is lea-king sir We must up Bur-tons and break out  Bur-tons and break out Now that we a-re nea-ring Ja-pan hea-ve-to he-re for a week to tin-ker a par-cel of old hoops Eit-her do that sir or was-te in o-ne day mo-re oil than we may ma-ke good in a ye-ar What we co-me twen-ty thou-sand mi-les to get is worth sa-ving sir So it is so it is if we get it  was spea-king of the oil in the hold sir   was not spea-king or thin-king of that at all Be-go-ne Let it leak  all a-leak my-self Ay-e leaks in leaks not on-ly full of lea-ky casks but tho-se lea-ky casks a-re in a lea-ky ship and thats a far wor-se plight than the Pe-quods man Yet  dont stop to plug my leak for who can find it in the dee-ploa-ded hull or how ho-pe to plug it e-ven if found in this li-fes how-ling ga-le Star-buck  not ha-ve the Bur-tons hois-ted What will the ow-ners say sir Let the ow-ners stand on Nan-tuc-ket beach and ou-tyell the Typ-hoons What ca-res Ahab Owners ow-ners Thou art al-ways pra-ting to me Star-buck a-bout tho-se mi-ser-ly ow-ners as if the ow-ners we-re my cons-cien-ce But look ye the on-ly real ow-ner of a-nyt-hing is its com-man-der and hark ye my cons-cien-ce is in this ships keelOn deck Cap-tain Ahab said the red-de-ning ma-te mo-ving furt-her in-to the ca-bin with a da-ring so stran-ge-ly res-pec-tful and cau-tio-us that it al-most see-med not on-ly e-ve-ry way see-king to a-void the sligh-test ou-tward ma-ni-fes-ta-tion of i-tself but wit-hin al-so see-med mo-re than half dis-trus-tful of i-tself  bet-ter man than  might well pass o-ver in thee what he would quic-kly e-nough re-sent in a yo-un-ger man ay-e and in a

bet-ter than hit-her-to Cap-tain Ahab Ahab sei-zed a loa-ded mus-ket from the rack for-ming part of most Sout-hSea-mens ca-bin fur-ni-tu-re and poin-ting it to-wards Star-buck ex-clai-med The-re is o-ne God that is Lord o-ver the earth and o-ne Cap-tain that is lord o-ver the Pe-quodOn deck For an ins-tant in the flas-hing ey-es of the ma-te and his fie-ry cheeks yo-u would ha-ve al-most thought that he had real-ly re-cei-ved the bla-ze of the le-vel-led tu-be But mas-te-ring his e-mo-tion he half calm-ly ro-se and as he quit-ted the ca-bin pau-sed for an ins-tant and said Thou hast ou-tra-ged not in-sul-ted me sir but for that  ask thee not to be-wa-re of Star-buck thou wouldst but laugh but let Ahab be-wa-re of Ahab be-wa-re of thy-self old man He wa-xes bra-ve but ne-vert-he-less o-beys most ca-re-ful bra-ve-ry that mur-mu-red Ahab as Star-buck di-sap-pea-red Whats that he saidA-hab be-wa-re of Ahabt-he-res so-met-hing the-re Then un-cons-cio-u-sly u-sing the mus-ket for a staff with an i-ron brow he pa-ced to and fro in the lit-tle ca-bin but pre-sen-tly the thick plaits of his fo-re-head re-la-xed and re-tur-ning the gun to the rack he went to the deck Thou art but too good a fel-low Star-buck he said low-ly to the ma-te then rai-sing his voi-ce to the crew Furl the tgal-lan-tsails and clo-se-reef the to-psails fo-re and aft back the mai-nyard up Bur-ton and break out in the main-hold  we-re per-haps vain to sur-mi-se e-xac-tly why it was that as res-pec-ting Star-buck Ahab thus ac-ted  may ha-ve been a flash of ho-nes-ty in him or me-re pru-den-tial po-li-cy which un-der the cir-cums-tan-ce im-pe-rio-u-sly for-ba-de the sligh-test symp-tom of o-pen di-saf-fec-tion ho-we-ver tran-sient in the im-por-tant chief of-fi-cer of his ship Ho-we-ver it was his or-ders we-re e-xe-cu-ted and the Bur-tons we-re hois-ted Upon searc-hing it was found that the casks last struck in-to the hold we-re per-fec-tly sound and that the leak must be furt-her off So it being calm weat-her they bro-ke out dee-per and dee-per dis-tur-bing the slum-bers of the hu-ge ground-tier butts and from that black mi-dnight sen-ding tho-se gi-gan-tic mo-les in-to the day-light a-bo-ve So deep did they go and so an-cient and cor-ro-ded and wee-dy the as-pect of the lo-wer-most punc-heons that yo-u al-most loo-ked next for so-me moul-dy cor-ners-to-ne cask con-tai-ning coins of Cap-tain Noah with co-pies of the pos-ted pla-cards vain-ly war-ning the in-fa-tua-ted old world from the flood Tier-ce af-ter tier-ce too of wa-ter and bread and beef and shooks of sta-ves and i-ron bun-dles of hoops we-re hois-ted out till at last the pi-led decks we-re hard to get a-bout and the hol-low hull ec-hoed un-der foot as if yo-u we-re trea-ding o-ver emp-ty ca-ta-combs and ree-led and rol-led in the sea li-ke an air-freigh-ted de-mi-john Top-hea-vy was the ship as a din-ner-less stu-dent with all Aris-to-tle in his head Well was it that the Typ-hoons did not vi-sit them then Now at this ti-me it was that my poor pa-gan com-pa-nion and fast bo-som-friend Que-e-queg was sei-zed with a fe-ver which brought him nigh to his en-dless end Be it said that in this vo-ca-tion of wha-ling si-ne-cu-res a-re un-known di-gni-ty and dan-ger go hand in hand till yo-u get to be Cap-tain the hig-her yo-u ri-se the har-der yo-u toil So with poor Que-e-queg who as har-poo-neer must not on-ly fa-ce all the ra-ge of the li-ving wha-le bu-tas we ha-ve el-sew-he-re seen-mount his dead back in a rol-ling sea and fi-nal-ly des-cend in-to the gloom of the hold and

the hol-ders so cal-led Poor Que-e-queg when the ship was a-bout half di-sem-bo-wel-led yo-u should ha-ve stoo-ped o-ver the hatc-hway and pee-red down u-pon him the-re whe-re strip-ped to his wool-len dra-wers the tat-too-ed sa-va-ge was craw-ling a-bout a-mid that dam-pness and sli-me li-ke a green spot-ted li-zard at the bot-tom of a well  a well or an i-ce-hou-se it so-me-how pro-ved to him poor pa-gan whe-re stran-ge to say for all the heat of his swea-tings he caught a ter-ri-ble chill which la-psed in-to a fe-ver and at last af-ter so-me days suf-fe-ring laid him in his ham-mock clo-se to the ve-ry sill of the door of death How he was-ted and was-ted a-way in tho-se few lon-glin-ge-ring days till the-re see-med but lit-tle left of him but his fra-me and tat-too-ing But as all el-se in him thin-ned and his cheek-bo-nes grew shar-per his ey-es ne-vert-he-less see-med gro-wing ful-ler and ful-ler they be-ca-me of a stran-ge sof-tness of lus-tre and mil-dly but dee-ply loo-ked out at yo-u the-re from his sic-kness a won-drous tes-ti-mo-ny to that im-mor-tal health in him which could not die or be wea-ke-ned  li-ke cir-cles on the wa-ter which as they grow fain-ter ex-pand so his ey-es see-med roun-ding and roun-ding li-ke the rings of Eter-ni-ty  a-we that can-not be na-med would steal o-ver yo-u as yo-u sat by the si-de of this wa-ning sa-va-ge and saw as stran-ge

Death which a-li-ke le-vels all a-li-ke im-pres-ses all with a last re-ve-la-tion which on-ly an aut-hor from the dead could a-de-qua-te-ly tell So tha-tlet us say it a-gain-no dying Chal-dee or Greek had hig-her and ho-lier thoughts than tho-se who-se mys-te-rio-us sha-des yo-u saw cree-ping o-ver the fa-ce of poor Que-e-queg as he qui-e-tly lay in his sway-ing ham-mock and the rol-ling sea see-med gen-tly roc-king him to his fi-nal rest and the o-ceans in-vi-si-ble flood-ti-de lif-ted him hig-her and hig-her to-wards his des-ti-ned hea-ven Not a man of the crew but ga-ve him up and as for Que-e-queg him-self what he thought of his ca-se was for-ci-bly shown by a cu-rio-us fa-vour he as-ked He cal-led o-ne to him in the grey mor-ning watch when the day was just brea-king and ta-king his hand said that whi-le in Nan-tuc-ket he had chan-ced to see cer-tain lit-tle ca-noes of dark wood li-ke the rich war-wood of his na-ti-ve i-sle and u-pon in-qui-ry he had lear-ned that all wha-le-men who died in Nan-tuc-ket we-re laid in tho-se sa-me dark ca-noes and that the fan-cy of being so laid had much plea-sed him for it was not un-li-ke the cus-tom of his own ra-ce who af-ter em-bal-ming a dead war-rior stretc-hed him out in his ca-noe and so left him to be floa-ted a-way to the star-ry arc-hi-pe-la-goes for not on-ly do they be-lie-ve that the stars a-re i-sles but that far bey-ond all vi-si-ble ho-ri-zons their own mild un-con-ti-nen-ted seas in-ter-flow with the blue hea-vens and so form the whi-te brea-kers of the mil-ky way He ad-ded that he shud-de-red at the thought of being bu-ried in his ham-mock ac-cor-ding to the u-sual sea-cus-tom tos-sed li-ke so-met-hing vi-le to the death-de-vou-ring sharks No he de-si-red a ca-noe li-ke tho-se of Nan-tuc-ket all

cof-fin-co-lou-red old lum-ber a-board which u-pon a long pre-vio-us voy-a-ge had been cut from the a-bo-ri-gi-nal gro-ves of the Lac-ka-day i-slands and from the-se dark planks the cof-fin was

ma-de the trans-fer per-ma-nent by cut-ting two notc-hes at its ex-tre-mi-ties This do-ne he mars-hal-led the planks and his tools and to work When the last nail was dri-ven and the lid du-ly pla-ned and fit-ted he ligh-tly shoul-de-red the cof-fin and went for-ward with it in-qui-ring whet-her they we-re rea-dy for it yet in that di-rec-tion Over-hea-ring the in-di-gnant but half-hu-mo-rous cries with which the peo-ple on deck be-gan to dri-ve the cof-fin a-way Que-e-queg to e-ve-ry o-nes cons-ter-na-tion com-man-ded that the thing should be ins-tan-tly brought to him nor was the-re a-ny de-nying him see-ing that of all mor-tals so-me dying men a-re the most ty-ran-ni-cal and cer-tain-ly sin-ce they will shor-tly trou-ble us so lit-tle for e-ver-mo-re the poor fel-lows ought to be in-dul-ged Lea-ning o-ver in his ham-mock Que-e-queg long re-gar-ded the cof-fin with an at-ten-ti-ve ey-e He then cal-led for his har-poon had the woo-den stock drawn from it and then had the i-ron part pla-ced in the cof-fin a-long with o-ne of the pad-dles of his boat  by his own re-quest al-so bis-cuits we-re then ran-ged round the si-des wit-hin a flask of fresh wa-ter was pla-ced at the

might ma-ke trial of its com-forts if a-ny it had He lay wit-hout mo-ving a few mi-nu-tes then told o-ne to go to his bag and bring out his lit-tle god Yo-jo Then cros-sing his arms on his breast with Yo-jo be-tween he cal-led for the cof-fin lid hatch he cal-led it to be pla-ced o-ver him The head part tur-ned o-ver with a leat-her hin-ge and the-re lay Que-e-queg in his cof-fin with lit-tle but his com-po-sed coun-te-nan-ce in view Rar-mai it will do it is ea-sy he mur-mu-red at last and si-gned to be re-pla-ced in his ham-mock But e-re this was do-ne Pip who had been sli-ly ho-ve-ring near

him Set-ting sail to the ri-sing wind the lo-ne-ly boat was swif-tly im-pel-led to lee-ward by both oars and can-vas  at last when Ahab was sli-ding by the ves-sel so near as plain-ly to dis-tin-guish Star-bucks fa-ce as he lea-ned o-ver the rail he hai-led him to turn the ves-sel a-bout and fol-low him not too swif-tly at a ju-di-cio-us in-ter-val Glan-cing u-pwards he saw Tash-te-go Que-e-queg

he saw all this as he heard the ham-mers in the bro-ken boats far ot-her ham-mers see-med dri-ving a nail in-to his heart But he ral-lied  now mar-king that the va-ne or flag was go-ne from the main-mast-head he shou-ted to Tash-te-go who had just gai-ned that perch to des-cend a-gain for a-not-her flag and a ham-mer and nails and so nail it to the mast Whet-her fag-ged by the three days

the wa-ves the un-pi-tying sharks ac-com-pa-nied him and so per-ti-na-cio-u-sly stuck to the boat and so con-ti-nual-ly bit at the plying oars that the bla-des be-ca-me jag-ged and crunc-hed and left small splin-ters in the sea at al-most e-ve-ry dip Heed them not tho-se teeth but gi-ve new row-locks to yo-ur oars Pull on tis the bet-ter rest the sharks jaw than the yi-el-ding wa-ter But at
